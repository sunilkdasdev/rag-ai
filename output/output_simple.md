## Hidden Payphones

The Metropolitan Opera. This is the one surviving payphone in the lowest floor in the basement below the stage. It is sadly not operational, but there's a penny in the change slot and everyone has made a silent agreement to leave it there.

## Gut Punch

We did not see this one coming.

It's really quite amazing how much we've been  through  over  the  years  with  HOPE. Our  Hackers  On  Planet  Earth  conference has always been full of surprises and challenges. We strove for edgy content and an inclusive atmosphere. We got all of that and more. Nobody wanted to stop.

Then COVID hit in 2020. Our hotel was torn down in the years after. Finding another hotel in the area proved to be impossible. So we shifted gears and wound up at St. John's University  in  the  neighboring  New  York City  borough  of  Queens.  We  didn't  regain the full attendance, but we were thrilled at the  extra  space  a  college  campus  offered, not to mention modern, working equipment. And the content remained every bit as good.

It was definitely different. But, as hackers, we tend to make different work.

The  bad  news  came  this  autumn  when we were told that an offensive pamphlet at HOPE\_16 in August had gotten the attention of the university president's office.  The matter was 'carefully reviewed internally' without a word to us and they came to the conclusion that HOPE should no longer be allowed to take place at St. John's.

We've had plenty of controversial material  over  the  years  in  one  form  or another  -  content,  images,  speakers,  etc. But every time there was a concern with a venue,  we  were  contacted  and  consulted. And each time, we were able to come to an understanding and, if necessary, take action that  we  were  comfortable  with  to  resolve the  situation.  Not  once  did  anyone  dictate what we couldn't do or say at our speaker presentations, workshops, or performances. We never would have tolerated that.

It's painful to realize that a college campus  -  where  freedom  of  expression  is supposed to be encouraged and celebrated - no longer appears to value this very basic premise. We've seen many examples lately of universities acting in panic to avoid being punished by an administration that is often quite hostile towards higher education. We're not saying this is necessarily what happened here. But the lack of communication and the way this all played out makes it difficult to come to another conclusion.

The  letter we  were sent claims that 'some  of  the  materials  and  messaging'

at  HOPE  'were  not  in  alignment  with  the mission, values, and reputation of St. John's University.'  This  is  an  incredibly  vague statement  that  could  be  applied  to  almost anything. We constantly question authority, look  for  ways  to  defeat  restrictions,  and encourage a spirit of peaceful rebellion. The very existence of HOPE could be the wrong messaging  in  the  eyes  of  someone  who doesn't  get  what  we're  all  about.  We  were eventually  told  the  actual  reason  was  the title of a pamphlet that was on a table which was interpreted as being 'anti-police.'

Several things: 1) The pamphlet in question  was  something  an  attendee  had brought which was not part of the conference program. 2) People are allowed to be antipolice.  It  seems  bizarre  to  shut  down  an entire  conference  because  an  attendee  has a  controversial  opinion.  3)  There  was  no attempt  made  to  discuss  or  address  this. Someone  with  an  obvious  ulterior  motive quietly took a picture of the pamphlet and reported it to the president's office after the conference  had  ended.  4)  The  offending phrase on the pamphlet ('Fuck tha Police') is  actually the title of an N.W.A. song that was  recently  ranked  by Rolling  Stone as Number 10 in "The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time" and Number 190 in the '500 Greatest  Songs  of All Time.'  According to  Wikipedia,  these  words  'continue  to influence  popular  culture  in  the  form  of t-shirts,  artwork,  political  expression,  and has  transitioned  into  other  genres  as  seen in  the  cover  versions  by  Bone  Thugs-nHarmony, Dope, Rage Against the Machine, and Kottonmouth  Kings.' Far from an ignorant and offensive phrase, these words actually are quite significant and represent a good bit more than might be obvious at first glance. (And even if they didn't, the reaction to them was completely out of proportion.) 5)  Not  one  person  had  complained  to  any of  the  HOPE  staff  about  this  or  any  other offensive content. It doesn't mean everyone agreed with everything they saw or heard. It  means they didn't see it as an issue that affected  the  conference  adversely.  6)  We got  along  great  with  everyone  involved  in law enforcement who was at or around the event and the feeling was mutual. There was even a mass graduation of police cadets on the first day that received well wishes from

many of our attendees.

We know this decision doesn't represent most  of  the  St.  John's  community,  who we've enjoyed working with greatly for the three conferences we've had there. And we don't  believe  the  fact  that  it's  a  religious institution was a factor here, as some have suggested. As mentioned, we've been seeing disturbing trends of this nature at a number of  universities.  In  the  end,  St.  John's  has the right to decide who they allow on their campus. We believe they made a big mistake here,  as  our  attendees  did  nothing  but  add to  their  reputation  and  significance  in  the world of high tech. Everyone from university liaisons to members of the security team to custodians  to  students  had  high  praise  for the  unique  individuals  we  brought  to  their campus. Those relationships will now go no further and it's a loss for all of us.

So what's next? Yet again, we find ourselves at a turning point.

We had originally scheduled HOPE 26 for next August at St. John's. Since that won't be happening, we've been looking into other possibilities.  There  will  be  more  updated information at either hope.net or 2600.com. But  we  must  also  decide  what  we  want  to do for the long term. We've had a pandemic, hotel  destruction,  and  now  eviction  get  in the  way  of  our  events  in  just  the  last  six years. Far from giving up, we intend to keep looking for a solution that will let HOPE not only survive, but prosper. That's the intent. But whether or not we actually achieve that is very much dependent on if enough people come forward and help that happen.

We've long held a belief that every time we get knocked down, we come back stronger. The outpouring of support so far has been quite  inspiring.  We  are  determined  to  do whatever it takes to make this event happen and for it to continue to be as significant and inspiring as it's become. Giving up just isn't an option.

***

Greg  Newby  was  the  best  of  us.  In  the decades where he was involved with HOPE and 2600 , he never stopped trying to make things  better.  Ironically,  it  was  he  who discovered St. John's as a location for HOPE after we lost the hotel. And if you're a digital subscriber to this magazine, it's his unique and  ingenious  program  that  delivers  it  to you each quarter. His belief that there was always a solution to whatever problem came along was what made him such a joy to be around.  At  HOPE,  he  somehow  found  the time to communicate and coordinate with so many attendees, speakers, coordinators, and venue staff when it would have been so easy to have been overwhelmed or discouraged.

When  Greg  learned  he  had  pancreatic cancer in the spring, he didn't give up or feel sorry for himself. In fact, he actually helped walk the rest of us through the experience with his calming tone and scientific analysis of  what  was  happening,  always  willing  to answer whatever questions any of us might have  had  about  the  horrible  experience  he was enduring. And while he wasn't able to make  it  to  HOPE  in  August,  it  meant  the world to him to see all those people during the closing ceremonies waving to him on the video screen, wishing him the very best that we could.

Greg  was  an  incredibly  talented  person whose skills could fill pages, yet he somehow found time to devote to the people and  the  passions  that  interested  him.  He loved raising sled dogs and going on races in the far north. He was incredibly athletic, running  ultra-marathons  (135  miles)  and finding time to walk at least a mile every day. And he was a key part of Project Gutenberg, serving as its CEO in a volunteer capacity, and  helping  that  organization's  efforts  to digitize  and  archive  cultural  works.  (His loved  ones  request  that  any  donations  be made in his name to gutenberg.org.)

We  will  feel  Greg's  absence  every  day in  one  way  or  another.  But  we  will  also be  inspired  by  what  he  gave  us  and  what he  gave  to  so  many  more.  His  kindness, determination, and strength will live within all of us.

## SnapSafe: Security on Android From Forensic Searches

I have been quite worried about some of the news  recently.  Photos  on  peoples'  phones  are being searched by authorities at border crossings and  even  traffic  stops.  Sometimes  with  dire consequences.

We have apps like Signal which help us keep our private chats private, but I could not find a satisfactorily secure app for keeping our photos safe. Not only from unwanted searches, but from auto-cloud backups, nosy friends, or a myriad of other attack vectors.

So  I  decided  to  write  one  myself:  SnapSafe ( snapsafe.org ).

It's a free and open source app (MIT licensed) and maybe it can help protect you.

This article will examine both the legal and technical security environment on Android and how SnapSafe aims to operate securely inside of it.

Along  the  way  we'll  learn  how  to  protect yourselves  more  generally  against  unwanted device searches.

## A Short Note About Threat Models

Understanding  your  own  threat  model  is important. State level intelligence services that have determined interest in you in particular are nearly impossible to defeat. The U.S. intelligence services built a replica of Iran's uranium enrichment facility so they could test their code against it. Then a team of engineers spent years developing a worm that deployed four zero-day exploits, each one of which would have sold for hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  on  the  dark web,  in  order  to  compromise  Iran's  systems. This  is  not  the  threat  model  most  of  us  enjoy. You have to understand your own risk, and pick your tools and practices accordingly. SnapSafe will not protect you against a determined state level actor, but not much will. It will, however, protect you against nearly anything else.

## Our Case Study

You're a U.S. citizen at a border checkpoint. Your phone is out of your control. It has been seized, and the attacker will attempt to extract as much data as possible from it.

Here is some important legal context: thanks to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, you have the right to refuse to provide information that could incriminate you.

Therefore, if your phone is locked, you cannot be  compelled  to  divulge  the  PIN,  because  it resides  solely  in  your  mind. However, U.S. courts have upheld that biometrics are not protected  in  this  way.  So  if  you  have  face  or fingerprint  unlock,  these  could  be  compelled from you and used to unlock your device. This by Adam Brown

brings us to our first security recommendation: Disable biometric authentication.

Once unlocked, you should still be protected from 'unreasonable search and seizure' thanks to  the  Fourth  Amendment.  In  2014,  the  U.S. Supreme Court ruled that probable cause is not enough to search your device and seize any data found  on  it.  A  warrant  would  be  required  for that, except at U.S. border checkpoints.

If you're a citizen, you can refuse to provide your PIN, and they cannot deny you entry. They do have the power to hold you there for a long time  and  cause  you  trouble  though.  If  you  are not a citizen, you can also refuse to provide your PIN, however they are then within their rights to deny you entry.

Border checkpoints are a huge legal gray area, even for U.S. citizens . They still cannot compel you to reveal a PIN, but if the device is already unlocked, or they unlock it via biometrics, then they  have broad authority  to  search  and  seize data found on it.

There are two forms of device search at the U.S. border as of today:

-  Basic Search
-  Advanced Forensic Search

## Basic Search

This  allows  the  agent  to  simply  use  your unlocked device. Open apps, read text messages, thumb through photos. This type of search has been used in recent months to discover photos that  were  in  'Recently  Deleted'  in  one  case, and  text  messages  in  another  case,  that  the border protection agent found objectionable and denied  the  person  entry  to  the  United  States. So it is definitely of concern, even if it is basic and  easy  to  defeat.  Protect  yourself:  Do  not have biometrics enabled and ensure the phone is locked before it is seized. Turning it off before entering a checkpoint is a pretty failsafe way to ensure the strongest security for your device.

SnapSafe  protects  against  this  attack  vector by simply having a PIN that should be separate from the rest of the device. No matter how the unlocked  device  got  in  the  attacker's  hands, they would have to compel a second PIN from you in order to access the photos stored within. Legally, they should not be allowed to do this, but SnapSafe has further protections in case it happens, which we'll get into later.

What if you happened to be browsing SnapSafe's  gallery,  then  switched  away  from the  app.  Your  gallery  would  still  be  visible  in the  task  switcher  even  without  opening  the app.  SnapSafe  protects  against  this  by  setting the secure flag on the application window. This

prevents screenshots, and will only show a blank screen in task switchers (aka recents ).

## Advanced Forensic Search

This  is  more  concerning.  In  this  case  the device is plugged into a computer and a forensic tool (such as Cellebrite's UFED tool or Grayshift's GrayKey) is used to extract as much data  as  possible  from  the  device.  Legally,  this data can be kept for a very long time. How long? It seems a bit ambiguous, so we should assume forever is a good possibility. That means the data could be subject to long duration offline attacks.

With  that  context,  let's  see  how  Android's security model can help protect us, and when it fails, where SnapSafe plugs the gaps.

## Android Security

Let's start with a primer on Android's layers of security.

Important:

- We will only be discussing Android 10 (API 29) and above.
- We will assume the device is not rooted, and has a locked boot loader, otherwise all bets are off.

## Full Disk Encryption

Android  requires  devices  to  use  full  disk encryption  (FDE).  Meaning  if  your  device  is powered off and is configured to require a PIN at  boot  time,  then  nothing can be extracted. If the disk were mirrored somehow, it would just be  an  encrypted  blob.  So  we've  come  to  our second security recommendation: Set a PIN to be required at boot.

Once the PIN is entered, the FDE key is kept in memory, and for all intents and purposes, the disk is now accessible.

## File Based Encryption

Once  the  disk  has  been  decrypted  and  the device is booted, only system level files are fully decrypted.  The  user's  data  is  still  encrypted, and the file based encryption (FBE) key is not resident in memory yet. If your phone is sitting at a lock screen, this is the state your phone is in. Hooking a phone up to a forensics tool in this state  would  not  provide  the  attacker  anything beyond boring system files.

FBE protects 'credential protected storage,' that  is  files  and  directories  which  are  only decrypted  when  the  user  has  provided  their credentials.

Each time you unlock your phone, the FBE key is loaded into memory, at which point your credential  protected  storage,  aka  user  data,  is now accessible.

In  this  state,  a  forensics  tool  can  extract  a broad  set  of  data.  What  types  of  data  are  we talking about? Data stored in public directories for:

-  Photos
-  Videos
-  Contacts
-  Downloads
-  SMS Messages

Data stored in app-private storage should be safe. Every app only ever has privileges to read and write its own files on Android. But there is a security loophole: app backups.

Android  provides  a  convenience  feature  to backup your apps, and all of their data. This is a well intentioned feature. It's designed to help if  your  device  is  lost  or  destroyed,  or  to  easily migrate  to  a  new  phone,  but  it  is  a  glaring security hole if your device is unlocked. The full data of each app can be exported, unencrypted.

SnapSafe protects against this style of search in two ways:

1. We never write anything to a public directory.
2. We explicitly disable all forms of app backup.

Thus on a non-rooted, non-exploited device, SnapSafe's data is safe so far.

If  everyone  was  playing  by  the  rules,  that would be the end of it - your data inside SnapSafe is  secure.  The  Android  debug  bridge  (ADB) used to pull these app backups is a normal piece of software. It follows all of the OS's rules and simply would not allow exporting of any of this data marked for no backup. This brings us to the third recommendation: Turn off developer mode and  USB  debugging  when  traveling.  This  will defeat casual or incompetent searches at least.

Unfortunately for us, most forensic tools don't stop there. Now we begin to think about how to protect ourselves when a tool is actively trying to subvert the built-in protections.

## Security Enhanced Linux

This is a Linux kernel module developed by the NSA in the early 2000s to greatly enhance the resistance of Linux to exploits. It enforces strict access  control  to  process  memory.  The  worry here  is  that  we  have  an  encryption  key  loaded into our processes' memory, and an attacker is able  to  read  our  processes'  memory  and  steal the key. SE Linux should provide robust security against this. SE Linux has been part of Android since 2013, and 100 percent of devices Android 10+ will have SE Linux enforcing mode enabled.

## Exploitation

We're going to get somewhat speculative here, I don't know how a tool will bypass SE Linux's protections,  or  Linux's  filesystem  permissions. But exploits exist, so we'll move forward assuming various levels of compromise.

Vulnerabilities  get  reported,  they  get  fixed, patches  get  deployed,  but  it's  often  up  to  the user  to  apply  these.  Having  a  device  from  a manufacturer that provides regular security updates is critical. Applying  those security updates in a timely manner to your own device

Most of the exploits these commercial forensic tools are using are well known. If the forensic company knows about the exploit, Google knows about the exploit, and there is almost certainly a patch for it. For most of us, these will not be zero-days  used  to  gain  access  to  our  device. Thus we come to our fourth recommendation: Keep up to date with security patches, and that should defeat most commercial tools.

## Filesystem Gets Compromised

In  this  scenario,  the  attacker  has  bypassed Linux's file permissions and gained access to  the  app-private  directories.  This  is  bad,  but SnapSafe is resistant to this type of attack.

Photos never touch the disk unless encrypted. Even  thumbnails  used  to improve  scrolling performance in the gallery are stored encrypted.

SnapSafe's  data  encryption  key,  the  most important thing to protect, is handled in one of two ways:

Key Wrapping: On devices that support it, we use the available hardware key store to wrap the data  encryption  key.  This  strongly  encrypted key is  saved  to  disk  and  should  be  sufficiently secure even against offline attacks.

Ephemeral Key: An alternative method of  protecting  the  key  is  to  only  ever  derive  it in  memory.  In  this  case  it  never  touches  the disk,  and  thus  nothing  would  be  stolen  if  the disk  was  compromised.  This  method  makes authenticating with the app slower though.

A note on hardware key stores: These are a crucial element of security on modern devices. These  contain  encryption  keys  in  a  separate secure part of the hardware. Even if your OS is compromised, the attacker cannot get the keys.

Any  Android  phone  made  after  2017  will contain at least a trusted execution environment (TEE).  On  certain  flagship  devices,  a  higher security model exists: the secure element. This is a physically separate chip, similar to a TEE, except it is resistant to a broader range of threats, including  chip-off  attacks.  SnapSafe  will  use whatever security hardware you have available, up to and including a secure element.

## Memory Gets Compromised

This is pretty much the worst case scenario, but  also  the  most  unlikely.  Everything  about both  SE  Linux  and  Android  is  designed  to prevent this. But as we say, unlikely events are not impossible events.

Individual  images  are  stored  transiently  in memory, one at a time when viewing a specific image. Thumbnails are a slightly bigger concern; they are stored in batches in an in-memory LRU cache.  These  are  lazily  loaded,  so  only  what has  been  requested  recently  would  be  resident in memory. If you had just been scrolling your gallery  and  your  memory  got  dumped,  the attacker would get a subset of the thumbnails.

The biggest concern though is the encryption key. Once derived, it is resident in-memory for the duration of your session.

We have two checks against this:

1. Key Sharding: Keys  are  not  stored  in  the clear  in  main  memory.  Instead,  they  are  split into two obfuscated parts using an XOR cipher. A partial memory dump could potentially miss one of the halves making the key unrecoverable. They are also obfuscated, which may hide them from automatic scanners looking standard AES keys.

2. Session  Timeouts: When  your  session expires,  sensitive  data  such  as  the  thumbnail cache  and  the  encryption  key,  are  securely evicted  from  memory.  This  means  that  any memory-based attack must execute within that time  window,  or  else  there  will  be  nothing  of importance to steal.

## Brute Forcing

Now we get to the less technical, more social weaknesses in our security chain.

If  the  user  has  a  four-digit  PIN,  it's  not inconceivable that it could be outright guessed. Or an automated process could brute force it in a reasonable amount of time. SnapSafe has several bulwarks against this.

First, a strong PIN is required. No repeating digits such as '1111' are allowed. No sequences such  as  '1234'  are  allowed.  The  top  ten  most common  PINs  are  also  blacklisted,  such  as '6969.'

Failed PIN attempts result in an exponential back-off,  making  each  successive  attempt  take longer and longer.

Finally, a maximum of ten failed attempts are allowed, after which all SnapSafe data is wiped.

Closing  the app  or restarting the device will  not  reset  the  back-off  timer  or  the  current number of failed attempts.

## All Security Is Vulnerable to a $5 Pipe Wrench

No matter how advanced our encryption and security practices, a $5 pipe wrench wielded in the right way can compel a PIN from you pretty quickly. It's a mostly apocryphal saying in cyber security,  mostly.  There  could  be  a  myriad  of reasons you feel forced to divulge a PIN. Maybe you will be denied entry if you don't. Recently a U.S. citizen, a lawyer who knew his rights, was being compelled to divulge his PIN for a phone search.  He  resisted,  but  eventually  decided  to divulge the PIN. I don't know why he made that choice,  but  it  can  happen.  The  point  is:  even though technically and legally your data is safe, for social reasons, it might not be.

SnapSafe has a feature to help protect against this. It's a feature of last resort: the poison pill.

This  is  an  advanced  feature  not  set  up  by default.  The  user  creates  a  second  PIN,  the poison  pill  PIN  (PPP).  If  the  user  is  being coerced for a PIN, and they determine they must hand it over, they can provide the PPP instead of their true PIN.

When entered, it will wipe all of SnapSafe's photos and thumbnails from disk and then log the attacker in as if nothing untoward has happened. They will have full access to the app after that. However, in this rather extreme scenario, it may seem suspicious to the attacker that your secure photos app is empty. Why do you have it if you don't have any secret photos after all?

So  ahead  of  time,  the  user  can  take  several benign photos and mark them as decoys. Then, when  the  poison  pill  is  activated,  these  decoy photos will be preserved. Now the attacker will browse  a  gallery  full  of  uninteresting  photos, and will be none the wiser.

## So What Have We Learned?

The fundamental underpinning of Android's security model are solid. For most of us, it often comes down to higher level problems. A weak PIN, biometrics, unapplied security updates, or careless  apps  that  simply  move  deleted  photos to another folder rather than truly deleting them.

Unfortunately, we must take our security into our own hands. With a little bit of knowledge, and a couple of thoughtfully designed apps, such as Signal, we can indeed protect ourselves.

## Key Takeaways

-  Know your rights!
- Require a PIN at boot
- Disable biometrics
- Disable developer mode (ADB) and revoke all authorizations
- Keep your device software up to date
- Optionally: Turn your device off before entering a checkpoint
- If  you  need  a  secure  way  to  take  and  store photos, SnapSafe could be a good option for most threat models.

## Trust Me - I'm Lying: Psychology and Social Engineering

by N0x

You  lock  your  doors,  set  strong  passwords, and  install  antivirus  software.  But  what  if  the biggest risk isn't your technology - it's you.

The art of manipulating people into performing actions, or divulging sensitive information  is  as  old  as  humanity  itself.  An innate survival tool, baked into our evolutionary DNA. Imagine Neanderthals living in communities  where  persuasion,  deception,  and influence  were  crucial  to  survival.  A  stronger hunter might boast about a kill to secure a better share of food or exaggerate their prowess to win a mate. A gatherer might convince the group to avoid a dangerous area - not out of caution, but to keep the best food sources for themselves. These primal forms of manipulation weren't malicious; they  were  tactics  to  improve  one's  odds  in  a brutal, unforgiving world.

As  society  advanced,  so  did  our  methods. Ancient traders likely oversold the value of their goods to get a better deal. Medieval spies wormed their  way  into  enemy  courts,  pretending  to  be allies. Con artists in the 1800s crafted elaborate personas  to  scam  their  way  into  fortunes.  It's all  about  understanding  human  behavior  and exploiting it to get what you want. And in many ways, that drive - to find shortcuts, to persuade, to  manipulate  when  necessary  -  isn't  a  flaw  in our nature. It's  part  of  what  helped  us  survive, build civilizations, and dominate the planet.

Social engineering helps us manipulate human behavior - our desire to help, or perhaps our fear of getting in trouble. We're full of instincts and emotions we've built  up  throughout  our  lives  rules we follow that help us 'fit in' and not just survive, but flourish. Over time, those of us who look  for  vulnerabilities  noticed  that  it  can  be disturbingly  easy  to  turn  those  instincts  in  our favor.

As  technology  evolves,  human  psychology remains  the  most  constant  vulnerability.  Tools like  ChatGPT,  deepfake  technology,  and  other AI-assisted content generators have made social engineering more effective than ever. Generating phishing emails, creating fake websites or landing  pages,  and  even  producing  your  own malware  is  now  accessible  to  anyone  with  an Internet connection - and these tools allow us to create  convincing  payloads  in  a  fraction  of  the time. It's 2025, your brain is a port, and hackers know exactly how to connect.

If  you've never foraged through the methods of  using  social  engineering  for  initial  access, you're overlooking what's often the easiest way into  any  system.  I'd  encourage  you  to  learn  as much as you can about human psychology, and even  sales  tactics  -  both  of  which  will  greatly improve your chances of initial access. There are plenty of great psychology-, sales-, and hackingfocused publications out there that can directly and indirectly teach you more about the topic. For instance, in the book Influence: The Psychology of  Persuasion, Robert  B.  Cialdini  approaches sales  in  a  science-based  manner.  By  outlining tactics and methods that aim to build rapport and trust with people quickly, he helps pave the way

for a hacker to build a sound social engineering methodology.  These  concepts  are  vital  to  any social  engineering  or  phishing  effort:  get  the target to like and trust you quickly, which opens them up to further emotional manipulation.

A  great  way  to  find  success  in  any  social engineering or phishing engagement is to target  emotions  -  that  which  makes  us  human. This can come in many forms, but you'll often find  success  leaning  into  one  (or  more)  or  the following categories:

Urgency: Creating  a  sense  of  urgency  might invoke  a  quick  response/click  from  the  target. You  want  them  to  engage  their  mouse  before they engage their brain.

Authority: Impersonate a person of authority (executives,  IT  staff)  to  gain  compliance  from your target regarding your request.

Trust: Build rapport, appear to be a friendly, likable, legitimate individual - to bypass normal social/security skepticism.

Curiosity/Greed: Use  promises  of  rewards, freebies, or special access -exploiting the target's  greed  or  initial  curiosity.  Send  out  an email saying there was a cat found in the parking lot,  with  a  link  -  asking  if  anyone  has  helpful information.  People  may  jump  to  click  a  link, hoping to see a picture of a cat... and curiosity kills more than cats.

Helpfulness/Sympathy: You might feign distress  or  ask  for  help,  exploiting  the  target's desire  to  be  a  good  person  (everyone  likes  to feel good about helping people!). Something that seems like a quick/low effort task to a stranger might be your ticket in.

Reciprocity: You may  provide something of value to the target first - creating a sense of obligation  to  respond  or  help  you.  There's  a reason some charities mail out dimes/nickels to people they're asking for donations from.

Social  Proof: 'I just spoke with Jim in accounting, and he mentioned you'd be the best one to ask about the inventory list below: [link]' -  using  the  target's  social  circle  as  proof  that you're  a  trusted/safe  person.  So  go  ahead  and click that link for me....

Scarcity: Make it rare/desirable - maybe there are only three free tickets left to that concert, or two hours left in the sale, or 'the first ten people who claim the code get the discount,' etc.

Commitment and Consistency: Once a target takes a small action with you, you're on the way to  building  more  rapport.  You  can  potentially build  that  relationship  and  get  more  and  more help from them.

Regarding the list above - remember, you only need to sprinkle in enough of any of them to get the target to click a link, or reveal a small piece of information you need.

Now, outside of (or perhaps overlapping with) human  emotions,  exists  a  tangential  target  we can  keep  in  mind,  that  of  human  tendencies. You'll  often  find  that  people  will  tend  to  write down  passwords.  This  can  look  like  stored plaintext documents on their desktop, or maybe thinking they're 'hiding it' within source code, or even scribbling it down on a notepad or sticky note sitting right next to their system. They do this  because  as  humans,  we  tend  to  strive  for the path of least resistance, and we often fall to convenience  over  security.  Keep  that  in  mind. Perhaps  you're  posing  as  a  member  of  the  IT staff, or an IT vendor the target company uses. Sometimes  success  comes  with  introducing  a problem,  explaining  a  complex  fix,  and  then 'suddenly remembering'  that there  may  be another,  quicker  way  we  could  try  first  -  and send a link to a payload or malicious login page to  capture  credentials.  Offering  a  quick  and convenient solution to a problem you created can work wonders.

Let's take the concept of human tendencies a step further with password rotation mistakes. We like to tell ourselves we're being more secure by rotating our passwords. But many people simply add  predictable  changes  to  bypass  the  hassle of  needing  to  remember  another  password  to another platform (once again, convenience over security  at  play).  Things  such  as  adding  a  '1' to  the  end  of  their  current  password,  or  maybe adding  an  exclamation  point,  etc.  These  often give enough of a change that the platforms accept the new password, but ultimately don't solve the initial  problem.  This  leads  to  situations  where even old and outdated credential leaks can still have quite an impact toward bad actors figuring out current passwords - somewhat defeating the purpose of changing the passwords periodically.

Over  time,  one  thing  remains  true:  social engineering  is  effective.  Understanding  human psychology  is  a  surefire  way  to  increase  your odds  of  getting  what  you  want.  It  essentially allows  us  to  create  our  own  race  conditions within the mind of the target, with the hope that they follow the flood of chemicals and emotions in their body before they decide to stop and think logically  about  the  details  of  what's  occurring. When  emotions  run high (fear, excitement, urgency),  rational  thought  often  takes  a  back seat.  We  all  like  to  think  we're  more  clever than we are, that we're too smart to be tricked so easily. Though, maybe we need to consider are  we  really  as  sharp  at  4:45  pm  on  a  Friday when we're itching for the weekend and notice that link to a new movie trailer we've been dying to see?! Maybe we click it, maybe we don't. One thing's for certain: the adversary is going to try again  tomorrow,  and  we  only  need  to  mess  up once.

## Should ICEBlock Be Open Source?

## by aestetix

At  HOPE\_16  this  past  August,  a  talk by ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron stirred a  bit  of  controversy.  During  questions,  a group of attendees consistently raised one point:  why  is  this  tool  not  open  source? They  raised  questions  around  the  topic from  multiple  angles,  and  Joshua  held firm that he would not release the source code.  This  revealed  an  interesting  rift  in the  hacker  world  about  whether  all  code should be open source.

as a factor.

One  reason this rift seems new  is that historically, the debate has been about money. It goes all the way back to Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates' 1976 'Open  Letter  to  Computer  Hobbyists,' in  which  he  makes  a  strong  argument  in favor of making money from proprietary software. The counter to this has traditionally come from organizations like the Free Software Foundation, whose founder  Richard  Stallman  (RMS)  views code  as  speech.  RMS  famously  makes the  distinction  between  free  as  in  beer (money), and free as in freedom (agency). In this view, making money plays second fiddle  to  ensuring  that  code  is  free  and can  be  modified  in  the  future.  Eric  S. Raymond also writes about this in his book The  Cathedral  and  the  Bazaar ,  where he  contrasts  the  top-down  hierarchical operating systems and ecosystems represented by Microsoft against the more creative panoply  that exists in Linux. Because of this background, we typically associate  closed  source  with  proprietary and money, and open source with freedom to change code and maybe make money if the license permits.

Aaron's  ICEBlock  project  employs  a bizarre  hybrid  model:  closed  source  but free.  He  is  bankrolling  the  project  and supporting systems out of his own pocket, and makes it free to everyone who wants to use it. ICEBlock does not collect data, it  does  not  track  anything  persistently, and it even includes safeguards to protect identities  of  users.  This  is  all  fantastic, but it has challenged people because these kinds  of  projects  are  also  usually  open source. Therefore, it's worthwhile to step back  and  reconsider  the  open  vs.  closed source debate, this time excluding money

## Open Source

At  its  heart,  open  source  feels  like  an ultimate expression of  freedom.  RMS would naturally disagree, because he has  often  argued  that  the  phrase  'open source' is an ambiguation that distorts the fact that, in his opinion, certain licensing schemes  permitted under open source allow  software  to  be  less  free.  However, since we are excluding money as a factor, RMS's objection is no longer as relevant.

So how free (as in freedom) is open  source?  Assuming  that  we  have the technical skills and the requisite technology, we can take any open source project and run it on our own computers. We can also modify it, fix bugs, contribute to a community, etc. These are all things touted  by  open  source  advocates  as  very important,  and  there is  an  underlying principle, coming from Linux creator Linus  Torvalds:  'given  enough  eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.'

But a few problems arise. First, reading code is not the same as understanding it. While  code  is,  in  theory,  deterministic, applications  of  the  code  are  not.  We  can use  checksums and other tools  to  ensure a compiled binary matches what we expect, but we can't be sure how the code will  run  on  different  operating  systems and different hardware. There is a reason that the Linux kernel has a massive base of  device  drivers,  and  there  are  constant debates  over  whether  to  keep  drivers  for technology like floppy drives.

Second, software can be quite complex. One  of the reasons the 'bug fixing' argument  doesn't  really  work  is  because modifying  code  on  a  large  project  can create all sorts of unintended side effects. Fixing  one  bug  may  accidentally  lead  to another,  worse  bug.  Some  projects  like vim  and  the Linux  kernel have  been maintained for decades, and require comprehensive institutional knowledge to effectively improve code without creating  issues.  Just  because  software  is open source doesn't mean a hacker wants to  sink  two  days  into  trying  to  fix  a  bug or add in a new feature, especially when there might be a competing software tool

that does what they want already, open or closed. In this sense, the 'open source is good' argument doesn't scale very well.

Third, the phrase 'open source' is often  used  to  virtue  signal  that  the  code is inherently trustworthy. It is true that if we lay out all the source code for people to review, that we may get some assurance that it is safe to use. It is also true that there is  no  real  incentive  for  people  to  review every  line,  and  touting  the  open  source label  may  convey  an  unmerited  sense  of trust which ironically leads to laziness and poor  code.  How  many  software  projects on GitHub are open source, but have not been reviewed by anyone?

Fourth, when we make something open source, we assume people will respect  the  license  we  grant  it  with.  But the  reality  is  that  we  are  giving  away our  hard  work  with  no  way  to  enforce the  license.  How  often  has  a  company taken an open  source  project, deleted the  license,  swapped  out  the  logos  and copyright with its own, and then sold the software as if they themselves created it? Obviously this is a bad thing, but when we make  something  open  source,  the  sense of  intellectual  property  and  ownership becomes diluted, partly because of potential contributors, and partly because there  is  no  point  to  'owning'  something if we cannot enforce said ownership (*coughblockchaincough*). If we insist on open source, we lose the ability to ensure that our hard work will be respected.

## Closed Source

It goes without saying that  making software closed source carries its own set of problems. While exposure to thousands of lines of open source code might blind a  reviewer  with  an  overwhelming  sense of  complexity,  closed  source  is  equally blinding  because  it  presents  reviewers  a black box. We can analyze the inputs and the outputs, but there is no way, short of reverse engineering the compiled binaries, to be sure why a given input leads to a given output.  Because  of  this,  a  closed  source software project has a larger emphasis on the  inputs  and  outputs.  If  a  given  input does not produce an expected output, then we send in a bug report to the developer, and test again in the next iteration to see if the bug has been fixed. Further, closed source reduces the chances of community code-level bug fixes from unlikely to zero. Next, clear ownership has its own downsides.  If  we  create  a  closed  source project, we  become  a  single  point  of failure.  If  something  in  the  code  breaks, it  is  our  fault,  and  we  are  the  only  one who  can  fix  it.  If  there  are  a  lot  of  new features other people want, we become the bottleneck to  making sure those features get developed. And if we become unable to  continue  working  on  the  project  for whatever  reason, there is no way  for someone else to pick up where we left off. A  few  years  ago,  Bram  Moolenaar,  who had been the head maintainer of vim since the late eighties, unexpectedly passed away. Because the project was open source and had many contributors, vim has been able to live on. Had it been closed source, Bram's  passing  would  also  have  likely been the death of vim.

Whereas 'open source' seems to be a term  that conveys  trust, 'closed source'  and  'proprietary'  are  terms  that convey corporate greed, likely due to the traditional use of the terms. As with open source, the sentiment here is not entirely fair: in fact, for many code bases, the trust model  is  remarkably  similar  for  closed source.  Realistically,  only  a  few  people will  read  the  code  of  many  open  source software projects,  so  rather  than  trusting the  code,  we  are  trusting  those  people. And  the  same  is  true  of  closed  source. In general, if a software project has been around for a long time and the code has worked for years without any major issues, we  trust  the  code,  meaning  we  trust  the people who create the code. By this logic, if a closed source project has been around for  many  years,  we  could  also  trust  the creator  of  it,  provided  nothing  bad  has happened.

## Concluding Remarks

In  the  end,  if  we  remove  the  money factor  and  take  a  brutally  honest  look  at the facts, there is no clear victor. Obviously for ICEBlock in particular, there are more things to consider, such as whether to trust Apple,  and  some  political  commentaries that  are  beyond  our  present  scope.  But the  conclusion  seems  to  be  that,  despite decades of discussion showing otherwise, that  being  closed  source  should  not  be enough to discount the trustworthiness of a software project.

## Telecom Informer

by TProphet

Aloha, and greetings from the Central Office! I'm on the Big Island of Hawaii, on the east coast, in  an  area  called  Leilani  Estates.  It's  a  sleepy, laid back place near Pahoa, down the road from Hilo, on a part of the island far from where most tourists  come.  In  fact,  very  few  ever  venture into Leilani Estates, which is probably why you haven't heard of it. However, it's on the eastern slopes of Kilauea, which creates some conditions best described as exciting.

I'm normally dealing with trees, drunks, and backhoes. Hawaii's network planners get all of that  plus  an  active  volcano  that  occasionally decides  to  rearrange  the  outside  plant  with  a few  hundred  million  tons  of  molten  rock.  In 2018, Kilauea's lower East Rift Zone went on a 107-day rampage, resurfaced roughly 35 square kilometers,  wiped  out  over  700  structures,  and buried  around  30  to  50  miles  of  roads.  Along the way, it destroyed about 900 utility poles and cut off the island's geothermal plant, which had been providing a big chunk of the area's electric power.

The  volcano  didn't  'target'  infrastructure, but  utility  corridors  are  laid  out  where  people live and where the roads are. Lava just followed the same terrain we did. Highway 132 and 137 (the  main  arteries  for  Puna)  were  covered  with molten rock. Once the roads disappear under tens of feet of ' a ' a and pahoehoe, your standard 'roll a truck' playbook goes right out the window.

The  electric  grid  and  telecom  plant  in  the flow  field  weren't  just  damaged;  they  stopped existing!  Poles,  copper,  fiber,  water  lines,  the whole  nine  yards  were  entombed  in  rock  hot enough to set utility poles on fire at ground level. In  one  neighborhood,  crews  watched  wooden poles quietly smolder from the heat still coming off adjacent flows. You don't learn how to handle that in a generic 'outside plant' safety video.

Lava also created lots of little 'islands' called kipuka. Houses and poles in some pockets never got  hit,  but  everything  upstream  feeding  them was  gone.  From  the  customer's  point  of  view, the  line  'looked  fine.'  From  the  utility  side, those  pockets  might  as  well  have  been  on  the moon. You can't jumper around a 40-foot wall of rock with a ladder and a few spans of cable. Assessment and materials  moved  by  helicopter instead of bucket truck, with air quality monitors keeping an eye on SO 2 and vog the whole time.

Once the lava cooled enough to walk on (more

or less), the real fun started: rebuilding on top of rock that's still hot inside. Basalt is an excellent insulator. The crust can be cool enough for boots while the interior sits at pizza-oven temperatures for  months. The usual 'dig a hole in dirt, drop in a pole' doesn't work when there is no dirt . So engineers started drilling 'rock sockets' - deep shafts  into  the  flow,  then  dropping  poles  and backfilling with high-strength concrete. It's slow, noisy, and every hole is a geology surprise. Some spots are solid; others hit voids and lava tubes.

Undergrounding  (the  thing  people  love  to demand after every storm) makes even less sense on an active lava field. You can't locate, splice, or reroute conduit that's 40 feet under rock. In Puna, regulators and the utility ended up deciding that overhead 69 kV back into the geothermal plant was actually the resilient choice. If the volcano comes  back  for  a  second  round,  you  sacrifice a  line,  move  the  poles,  and  try  again.  The  key isn't making  plant  immortal;  it's making  it replaceable.

Topology  mattered  as  much  as  materials. Before  2018,  a  lot  of  Puna's  telecom  backhaul was classic rural spur: one fiber bundle marching out from Hilo into the district. Cut it at the wrong choke point and every community downstream goes dark. When lava crossed those roads, that's exactly what happened.

Since then, Hawaiian Telcom has been busily closing  loops.  In  2023,  they  spent  about  $1.5 million to stitch a 25-mile gap between Volcano and  Pahala,  completing  an  East  Hawaii  fiber ring. That way, if a fiber cut occurs, service can be routed the other direction. Federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program (BEAD) money (roughly $149 million for Hawaii alone) is also being shoveled into rural broadband under the 'Internet for All' banner. Connect Kakou, the statewide broadband effort, is  trying  to  use  that  pile  of  cash  to  make  sure the next eruption hits as much fiber as it wants and still doesn't knock the whole island offline. That's the theory, anyway. Here on the ground, fiber  to  the  home  is  available  throughout  much of Leilani Estates, but upstream infrastructure is the bottleneck. There are all sorts of goofy edge cases like two houses on the same street having service available, but a third being outside of the coverage area. Eventually, fiber to the home will be available everywhere, but the operative word is 'eventually.'

Fiber, poles, and rock sockets are still terrestrial. When the ground is literally moving, you also need something that isn't on the ground. That  brings  us  to  the  microwave  and  satellite side of the house. Puna has a legacy of big, ColdWar-era towers from the old AT&amp;T Long Lines network, back when people worried about nuclear war  cutting  toll  routes.  Those  sites  now  make handy anchor points for modern microwave. In 2018,  and  later  during  the  Maui  fires,  carriers leaned hard on point-to-point microwave hops to jump over areas where poles had burned or fiber turned into slag. The FCC handed out emergency authorizations to light up temporary links, which were used to fill the gaps.

Microwave was only half the problem; power was the other half. Many remote cell and relay sites stayed up on diesel generators until access roads vanished under lava or fire. Once the road is gone, though, so is your fuel truck. After 2018, there  have  been  more  deployments  of  solarplus-battery  'hybrid'  sites  where  the  generator becomes a backup to the backup. It's a lot easier to fly in a pallet of batteries occasionally than to sling diesel every few days by helicopter.

The  really  new  piece,  which  didn't  exist  in 2018, is the satellite overlay: Starlink and friends. In  Maui's  2023  fires,  various  groups  hauled  in dozens of Starlink terminals on very short notice, and  later  reports  talk  about  hundreds  of  kits across the island as relief scaled up. Park a dish at a distribution center, connect it to a generator, and suddenly that parking lot has enough bandwidth to  serve  the  entire  area.  Emergency managers  used  those  links  to  ship  giant  drone imagery sets and GIS data for analysis.

For  the  next  round  of  volcanic  fun  on  the Big Island, the plan is to not wait until after the disaster.  There  are  already  subsidy  programs quietly helping rural households in hard-to-reach areas to put Starlink dishes on their own roofs. From  a  resilience  point  of  view,  every  one  of those terminals is a tiny, community-owned 'cell tower in space' backhaul path. If the poles on the street burn, the dish doesn't care. However, the area  is  densely  forested  and  -  adding  another wrinkle - the area's property crime rate is fairly high  (anything  that  isn't  nailed  down  is  often stolen). So the jury is still out on how well this will work.

Even  more  interesting  is  the  direct-to-cell work: satellites with LTE base stations onboard, talking straight to ordinary phones on the ground. Tests  are  underway  in  Hawaii  with  national carriers and experimental licenses. If that pans out, someone trapped on a kipuka with a phone and a clear view of the sky could receive wireless emergency alerts and send a text with their GPS coordinates even if every tower in line of sight has fallen over. The last mile literally becomes the last few hundred kilometers of space.

Meanwhile,  the  state's  own  radio  network (known  as  HIWIN)  is  being  hardened  with satellite  backhaul  options.  The  idea  is  simple:

if  microwave  from  the  mountaintop  radio  site back to the core fails, a Starlink dish takes over and  keeps  police  and  fire  repeaters  on  the  air. No matter what happens between the tower and the  ground,  the  tower  still  has  a  path  back  to dispatch.

All  of  this  costs  real  money,  and  regulators finally realized you don't get resilience by paying utilities  to  rebuild  the  same  brittle  stuff every time lava or wind knocks it down. Hawaii's Public Utilities Commission moved electric utilities to performance-based regulation: instead of just earning on capital they pour into more poles, they get paid based on outcomes like uptime and restoration time. In theory, it makes microgrids, solar-hybrid sites, and fiber rings just as financially attractive as another row of wood sticks in a known hazard zone.

There's also the 'soft' side of resilience that doesn't live on a pole at all. The Pahoa Lava Zone Museum keeps the story of 2018 front and center for  locals  and  tourists.  It's  well  worth  a  visit, and contains all of the original exhibits from the U.S. Park Service visitor center destroyed in the 2018  eruption.  Community  'digital  detective' campaigns log where broadband actually works versus where the maps claim it works, steering BEAD  and  other  funds  into  the  right  census blocks. People in Puna may be living with lava risk,  but  with  decent  connectivity  they  can  at least  work,  study,  and  see  a  doctor  over  video without driving an hour to Hilo.

So what can the Kilauea eruption teach you,  even  if  you  don't  have  a  volcano  in  your backyard? A few things:

- Linear,  single-path  networks  are  a  network design that the planet doesn't respect. If there is  one  spur,  a  volcano  (or  backhoe,  or  ice storm) will eventually find it. Ring topologies are more expensive, but they're table stakes for resilience.
- Whatever  you  think  of  as  'hardening'  only gets  you  so  far.  On  a  long  enough  timeline, nature  wins.  Design  things  so  they  can  be moved,  sacrificed,  or  bypassed  rather  than banking on armor.
- Finally, satellite networks are gaining capabilities fast. In places where infrastructure is  untrustworthy,  putting  your  backhaul  in orbit  may  be  the  only  way  to  get  to  'always on' for critical services.

Hawaii  is  trying  to  become  the  first  fully fibered  state  while  simultaneously  embracing microwave,  microgrids,  and  LEO  satellites.  If they pull it off, Puna will be a case study in how to keep phones and packets moving on a planet that's still under construction.

And on that note, an alarm just lit up on the backup  generator  panel  here,  which  probably means somebody in Facilities forgot to order fuel again. I'm off to make a few calls before the lights go out. Stay safe, keep your loops redundant, and if  the  ground under your outside plant starts to glow, your life is about to get interesting.

## Without Further Ado, ROS 2

by Gazza

I would like to start this article with the proper way to write ROS 2. ROS 2 is written with a space between ROS and the number 2. This is how it is used in the official documentation and the brand guide. Why is this  even  an  issue? Well,  ROS  2 commands use the prefix 'ros2.' No space! For example, if you wanted to launch the file 'hello\_ world\_launch.py', the command would be 'ros2 launch hello\_world\_launch.py'. The absence of  a  space  between  the  ros  and  2  I  feel  results in  confusion  on  how  to  address  or  even  search for information on ROS 2. As a reader, I would question the seriousness of this issue. Well, there are memes, lots of memes, and even a YouTube video addressing this. 1

With that out of the way, let's talk about why the  switch  to  ROS  2.  The  ROS  1  framework began in 2007 by Willow Garage. At inception, Willow  Garage  was  working  on  a  single  robot. Additionally,  most  of  the  processing  was  done using an onboard computer. The network connections were reliable, and the intended use case did not require real-time system requirements.  Thirteen  distributions  later,  ROS has  been  widely  accepted  and  covers  a  variety of new use cases. Some of these new use cases include  running  multiple  robots  often  equipped with  microcontrollers.  Furthermore,  depending on the operational environment, network connections may be erratic at times. Thus, ROS 2 was written from the ground up with scalability and,  if  required,  real-time  processing  in  mind. While  ROS  1  targeted  Ubuntu,  ROS  2  can  run on Windows or even macOS. Language support is  more  versatile  in  ROS  2,  including Ada,  C#, Java, and Rust, expanding upon C++ and Python offered in ROS 1.

is  that  ROS  2  uses  a  different  middleware  for communication, specifically the Data Distribution Service  (DDS).  The  switch  to  using  DDS  is  to improve  performance  and  reliability.  There  are even Quality of Service (QoS) policies in place now.  Presently,  the  default  DDS  is  Fast,  but Cyclone is another possibility. In my experience working in simulation  in  ROS  2  Humble,  there was an issue where the maps were failing to load in  RViz2  when  using  FastDDS. The  solution  at the time was to switch to CycloneDDS. While the issue has probably been resolved by now, I have not  had  any  further  issues  using  CycloneDDS. If  using Jazzy, ZenohDDS is another possibility as well. The third major change is replacing the 'move\_base'  package  with  Nav2.  The  main difference is the inclusion of behavior trees with Nav2.  Although  the  use  of  costmaps  and  path planners is retained, the path planners have been updated  to  include  smoothers  and  pruners  for navigation.  The  fourth  and  final  major  change is  the  switch  from  Gazebo  Classic  to  Gazebo Simulation. In ROS 1, Gazebo Classic was tightly integrated into the ROS 2 architecture. However, in  Gazebo  Simulation,  a  bridge  is  required  to transform the Gazebo topics into ROS messages. The utilization of a bridge also offers the ability to use other simulation packages with ROS 2 in addition to Gazebo.

You may be wondering, as a ROS 1 developer, what  can  I  expect  when  switching  to  ROS  2? In  summary,  I  would  say  that  there  are  four main differences. The first difference is  that  the structure  of  the  launch  files  has  changed  from using  eXtensible  Markup  Language  (XML)  to using  Python.  The  learning  curve  for  ROS  was already steep, but adding a familiarity with Python makes it even steeper. Personally, I found that it was easier to manipulate XML files. For example, if  the  package that I was testing required a new transform, one additional line resolved the issue when using XML. Using Python, the solution is slightly more complicated. Full disclosure: it has been a minute since I have developed in Python and  my  skills  are  a  little rusty.  Fortunately, most  developers  provide  sample  launch  files and  include  the  variables  that  can  be  adapted to individual use cases.  The  second  change

Note that ROS 2 has been developed concurrently with ROS 1 since 2017 and is on its ninth release. However, with ROS 1 going End Of Life in May of 2025, there has been a recent push to transition to ROS 2. ROS 2 is even expanding into the space community for exploration of other worlds.  Note  that  Space  ROS  Jazzy  2025.04.0 was just released. 2  Demos for space ROS include the  Canadarm.  The  Canadarm  is  the  big  robot arm that  was  deployed  from  space  shuttles  and the Mars Rover. There is even code for running a space station. 3 Specifically, the demo recreates the ISS Nauka incident for fault analysis. Although both of those topics are outside the scope of this article, they demonstrate the capability that ROS 2  offers.  At  the  time  of  writing,  there  are  two ROS  2  versions  available,  specifically  Humble Hawksbill and Jazzy Jalisco. Of late, I have been developing mainly in Humble and this will be the focus for the remainder of this article.

As  a  reader,  I  know  what  you  are  thinking. If ROS 2 can really do that, it should be able to play Doom too. Well, in short it can. The code for Doom ROS can be found here. 4  The code comes prepackaged  in  a  Docker  container  for  easy installation and runs with the following command: 'ros2  launch  doom\_ros  doom\_ros.launch.py'.

Note that the joysticks currently tested are 8BitDo SN30 Pro +, Logitech F710, and DUALSHOCK 4 (PS4). However, a bag file is also included in the repository. Rather than install the full repository, I  choose  to  work  with  the  bag  file. A  ROS  bag file is a way to record ROS data over time. One can  replay  the  bag  file  and  remap  the  topics  to other ROS applications. For this article, I ran the Doom ROS through a visual odometry package. Specifically, I chose the 'stella\_vslam\_ros' ROS visual  odometry  package. 5   The  'stella\_vslam\_ ros' package is designed to ingest camera topics and output the pose of the camera as the camera moves.  However,  if  you  use  it  with  the  Doom ROS bag file, it can track the character's position throughout the level.  The 'stella\_vslam\_ros' package was compiled from source in my 'ros\_ ws/src' folder. This was accomplished using the following commands:

```

```
cd ros2_ws/src git clone https://github.com/ ➥ stella-cv/stella_vslam.git cd .. colcon build --symlink-install ```
```

Once stella vslam is complied and the Doom bag  file  downloaded,  then  to  get  everything running, I ran the following commands:

```

## Terminal 1:

ros2 bag play /2600/bag/doom\_

➥

rosbag/doom\_rosbag.db3

\# spacebar pauses/resumes

➥

playback

## Terminal 2:

ros2 run image\_transport

raw in:=doom\_image raw

➥

out:=camera/image\_raw

## Terminal 3:

export NO\_AT\_BRIDGE=1

export XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR=/run/

➥

ros2 run stella\_vslam\_ros run\_

➥

slam \

-v /2600/test/orb\_vocab.fbow

➥

msg \

--mask /2600/test/mask.jpg \ --ros-args -p publish\_

➥

tf:=false

```

The 'orb\_vocab.fbow' file can be found here. 6 The  'doom.yaml'  file  is  provided  below.  The 'mask.jpg'  was  something  I  created  to  prevent 'stella\_vslam\_ros' from detecting features in the bottom of the Doom screen (i.e., ammo, health, armor, etc.) since it is relatively static. The image is binary with a top white rectangle on a bottom black rectangle created in a drawing program.

## Doom.yaml

LoopDetector:

System:

map\_format: "msgpack"

num\_grid\_cols: 47

num\_grid\_rows: 30

```

The results of running the Doom bag file though the 'stella\_vslam\_ros' package can be seen in the image below. Note that the large frustum shows the character's current position. The smaller frustums show  where  the  character  has  been.  The  light (current frame) and dark (map) dots are visual key features that 'stella\_vslam\_ros' uses in its frame to map approach to track camera position or, in this case, player movement. The Doom bag file is only for level one. Thus, installing the full Doom ROS  repository  is  required  to  track  character movement through additional levels. As an aside, 'stella\_vslam\_ros' supports other inputs as well, including video files and image sequences, so it can be used with other games.

I hope you enjoyed exploring the capabilities of ROS 2. Stay tuned for future articles showcasing different  ROS  2  capabilities,  such  as  simulated environments, lidar odometry, and simultaneous localization and mapping.

## Using Linux in a VM as Your Daily Driver

by JMT

After having used Linux exclusively at home for nearly a decade, I recently found it necessary to  switch  to Windows, for professional reasons. I hated the idea and looked for any way I could find  to  avoid  it.  But  in  the  end,  it  couldn't  be helped.  (Executive  summary:  both  my  personal Linux computer and my work Mac Mini died at the same time, but I could only afford to buy one new computer.)

necessary;  I  can  try  out  new  distros  any  time, without impacting my main machine in any way. Hypothetically,  I  could  even  buy  a  brand  new computer, and just bring my VM over wholesale; I could copy it onto my laptop, and take it with me on vacation;  I  could  back  it  up  offsite.  The list goes on.

I  began  to  wonder,  though:  are  VMs  good enough  to  use  as  a  daily  driver?  Short  answer: Yes .

In fact, it works so well that I would likely keep it  this  way even if my initial reason evaporated. However,  it  was  neither  easy  nor  obvious  how to  get  it  working  smoothly  in  the  beginning -  good  enough  to  use  all  day,  every  day,  for everything. So I just wanted to share how I got my VM working well enough to use as my main computer, and what some of the advantages and disadvantages are.

## The Basic Setup

To  replace  both  computers,  I  bought  a  12core  Core  i9  @  3.4GHz  with  64GB  of  DDR5, two  internal  SSDs,  and  a  GeForce  3070,  with Windows 11 installed  as  the  host.  Since  this  is a  powerful system, I can afford to give the VM the resources it needs to function smoothly. The VM is Pop\_OS! 22.04 running as a guest inside Virtualbox on the D:\ drive, with control of eight cores and 32GB of memory.

I  use  Windows  11  exclusively  for  work,  and use the VM as my personal computer. I treat them as  if  they  were  two  separate  machines,  one  at home and one at the office.

## The Advantages

This setup is a dream. Creating it was an act of desperation, but now I wouldn't want to switch back. My daily driving experience in the VM is flawless. I can access any drive I need, including network  drives.  The  VM  has  full  control  of the  NIC,  so  I  get  100  percent  of  my  available bandwidth,  and  the  ability  to  effectively  use  a VPN, when such things become necessary. Audio and video sound and look great (I do get minimal screen tearing occasionally, but not nearly as bad as my initial tests, and not bad enough to bother me,  even  though  a  good  experience  watching video is one of my dealbreaker use cases).

When my VM is full-screen - which it always is if it's running - I forget I'm even using a VM. But when  I remember,  it affords additional advantages:  I  can  back  up  my  entire  computer and save it to an external drive in case anything goes  wrong;  I  can  create  restore  points  before I  make  major  changes,  and  roll  them  back  if

All  of  that  is  just  the  upside  of  basic,  daily computing.  But  for  my  particular  use  case  -  as a  freelancer  using  my  personal  computer  for both  my  livelihood  and  my  home  life  -  there are  additional  advantages.  First,  the  two  are completely separate. When I work, I shut down the VM and use Windows, and at 5pm I relaunch the VM. They are psychologically discrete spaces for the two sides of my life. Also, my Windows installation stays pristine - I installed the apps I need for work, and that's it. I don't have to worry (much)  about  something  suddenly  breaking  my Windows  PC,  and  with  it  my  ability  to  earn  a living.

Prior to this setup, I used Linux on bare metal, with a Mac Mini next to it for work. In between I  had  a  KVM  switch  and  a  USB  switcher  and an  audio  switcher  so  I  could  use  all  the  same speakers/monitors/peripherals. None of that extra bloat  is  necessary  now,  because  everything  is plugged into one computer.

## The Disadvantages

The  downside  is  surprisingly  small.  In  order to put the Windows host to sleep, I have to shut down the VM each night. I use 'save state,' so I just relaunch it in the morning and everything is as I left it. When I plug in a USB drive, I have to go through the extra step of routing it to the VM - but even that is only if it's a drive I might want to  access  on  Windows.  For  any  ext4  formatted drives,  the  system  routes  them  automatically through to the VM. Occasionally I have trouble getting a drive recognized, and I have to unplug it and plug it back in. As minor as these are, they are the only downsides I can think of.

## The Deets

I tested Virtualbox, VMWare, and Microsoft's built-in  Hyper-V  platform.  I  also  played  with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). But none of them worked out-of-the-box well enough for a daily  driver.  There  were  numerous  crashes,  and audio/video  playback  was  unacceptable  across the board.

Since nothing was working, I settled on Virtualbox  just  because  it's  what  I  was  most familiar with, so troubleshooting it made the most sense. I am certainly not saying the others won't work,  just  that  I  never  got  them  to  work  well. Here's how to do it with Virtualbox.

## Windows

There are numerous virtualization features of Windows 11 that conflict with the smooth running of other virtualization platforms, including Virtualbox.  In  my  testing,  I  found  that  with these enabled, I had severe crashing and network throttling  in  my VM - all of which disappeared once  these were  removed.  So  let's start  by disabling them all:

## Search for and run 'Turn Windows features on or off'

Disable the following:

-  Hyper-V
- Virtual Machine Platform
-  Windows Hypervisor Platform
-  Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Device Guard must be disabled separately:

- Run Powershell as Administrator
-  Run 'gpedit.msc'
- Computer  Configuration  --&gt;  Administrative Templates --&gt; System --&gt; Device Guard
- Right click, choose 'Edit'
- Select 'Disabled,' Apply

## Virtualbox

Next, create your virtual machine in Virtualbox; install your OS and Virtualbox Guest Additions. Your configuration may differ, but here are some of the settings I changed to ensure the best possible experience in the VM:

## Display

-  Video Memory: set to maximum (256 MB)
- Enable 3D Acceleration: checked (research indicates this setting may cause instability in some setups, but in my testing it was key for a good video watching experience)

## Audio

- Enable Audio Input: checked (for video chatting, etc.)

## Network

- Bridged (this mode gives the VM full control of the network card, allowing for the use of a VPN
- Promiscuous Mode: Allow All (just in case you want to run Wireshark)

## USB

- USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller (to ensure fast external drive access)

## Guest Virtual Machine

You should now have a stable VM with smooth local  audio/video  playback.  However,  in  my testing at this point, watching YouTube in Firefox was still subpar, with occasional audio popping/ crackling that I found to be a dealbreaker. Thankfully, I found a fix:

In  Firefox,  go  to  about:config  and  set  these parameters to false:

- media.webspeech.synth.enabled
- reader.parse-on-load.enabled

## Shared Folders

You will probably have the need to move files between host and guest at some point, so it's a good idea to set up a shared folder. In the settings for your VM:

- Click the + to add a new folder
- Folder Path: [choose a path on the host]
- Folder Name: [choose a name, or leave blank and VBox will handle this automatically]
- Mount Point: [choose a mount point for your guest, or leave blank and VBox will handle this automatically]
- Read-only [unchecked]
-  Auto-mount [checked]
-  Make Permanent [checked]

Now  you'll  have  an  easy  way  to  move  files between host and guest. (Note that if this setting is  not  available  to  you,  you  have  neglected  to install Virtualbox Guest Additions in your guest operating system.)

## External USB Drives

Accessing your data stored on external drives is important, and won't be a hassle. There are two ways to do it: temporary and permanent.

The  easiest  way  to  grab  a  USB  drive  that's plugged into your host is to press your Host Key (default is Right Ctrl) + Home and then navigate thusly: Devices -&gt; USB -&gt; [device]. (Pro tip: you can use arrow keys instead of the mouse.) This will immediately 'plug it in' to the guest VM.

For a more permanent solution - e.g., an ext4 formatted  drive  that  you  will  never  use  with your Windows host - simply set up a USB filter. Filter rules tell Virtualbox to grab whatever meets their criteria and pass it through to the guest VM any time it's plugged in. Do this by opening the settings  for  your  VM,  go  to  the  USB  section, and under USB Device Filters, click the + icon and select your drive from the list. It will create a rule that identifies your specific drive (or other USB  device),  and  passes  it  to  the  guest  VM immediately upon insertion.

## Final Thoughts

I  am  writing  this  from  within  my  virtual machine configured as described in the paragraphs above. I live my life in this computer and  99  percent  of  the  time  I  forget  it's  even  a VM. This started as a workaround to the problem of  not  being  able  to  afford  two  new  computers simultaneously, but now I wouldn't go back. If I hit the lotto tomorrow, I would keep it this way. If  I  suddenly  didn't  need Windows  any  more,  I would probably install Linux on the hardware and continue running this VM on top of it to keep the work/life separation and all the benefits outlined above.

I did tell one white lie. My  Windows installation  is  not  100  percent  work,  because  of course I installed Steam on it so I could finally play CyberPunk 2077 . Hack the planet.

## Decentralized Authentication Across the Web

by anachrohack

I recently finished the process of de-Googling my life,  and  one  of  the  hardest  aspects  was  all the accounts I had created with Gmail's SingleSign-On (SSO). I found myself stuck in Google's orbit because I had centralized my online identity within their authentication provider. It got me to thinking:  how  can  we  attest  to  a  single  identity across  the  web  using  a  decentralized  scheme? Can we break the stranglehold Big Tech has on our identities? The answer: client TLS certificates and DNS!

Bluesky  allows  users  to  claim  an  @domain. com username by setting a TXT record on their registrar with  a particular  code  provided  by Bluesky.  This  associates  the  account  with  that particular  domain  name,  allowing  a  handle  like @user.domain.com  instead  of  @user.bsky.app. What if  we  could  do  this  without  a  centralized authority? What if there was a cryptographic way to verify our identity?

TLS  allows  users  to  send  a  client  certificate during the handshake process (more specifically, it  allows  the  server  to  request  or  even  require a client certificate). If a client certificate is requested,  modern  web  browsers  will  prompt the  user  to  select  a  client  certificate  from  their operating system's certificate store. In Windows, you can create a self-signed certificate with:

New-SelfSignedCertificate

- -Subject "CN=username@mydomain. ➥ com"`
- -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\\
- ➥ CurrentUser\\My"`
- -KeyUsage DigitalSignature,KeyEn
- ➥ cipherment `
- -Type Custom `
- -KeySpec Signature `
- -KeyLength 2048 `
- -KeyAlgorithm RSA `
- -HashAlgorithm SHA256

This  will  be  automatically  saved  under  your personal  folder  in  the  certificate  store. You  can get the thumbprint of your cert (which cannot be faked):

anachrohack@pm.me

Get-ChildItem -Path "Cert:\\

- ➥ CurrentUser\\My"`
- | Where-Object {$\_.Subject -eq
- ➥ "CN=username@mydomain.com"} `
- | Select-Object Thumbprint
- &gt; # 400E0A39A... etc.

The user can then go to their domain registrar and create a TXT record:

\_identification.username.

- ➥ mydomain.com TXT 400E0A39A...

When they connect to a website which participates  in  this  scheme,  the  website  will accept all self-signed certificates. At the application level, it will read the subject line of the certificate ( CN=username@mydomain.

- ➥ com ) and send a DNS query for TXT records for the  domain \_identification.username.
- ➥ mydomain.com .  If  the  thumbprint  from  the client  certificate  matches  the  thumbprint  in  the TXT record, the server can attest that this user is, in  fact, username@mydomain.com without having to have ever met this user or even store credentials on the server. A user's identity is now portable across participating services!

This approach is not without risk:

- If the server's DNS resolution is compromised, a MITM attack is trivial. This can be mitigated if the server uses DNSSEC.
- Domain  squatters  can  impersonate  people  or companies whose domain names they own.
- The user must keep their key secure (though this is more  secure than a user re-using passwords  across  sites!).  If  a  user's  private key is compromised, they must delete the TXT record  from  their  registrar,  which  can  take precious  minutes  to  propagate  through  DNS caches.

But  these  are  the  same  concerns  which  face all identity providers, and have well documented mitigation  techniques.  I  hope  that  this  can  at least spawn  discussion  around  similar  ideas. Decentralization is power! If you want to discuss further, you can email me at the address above.

## wpUsers.sh: Countering Disinformation With a Simple Bash Script

by Greg 'Dial Tone' Norcie

(first initial at last name dot protonmail dot ch)

As I sit down to type up this article, it's Election Day here in the so called 'Paris of Appalachia' and once again I'm sitting in the back corner of the same combination coffeeshop and bookstore abusing the Wi-Fi like it owes me money.

Anyways...  disinformation.  We've  all  been there.  Someone...  possibly  a  PAC  funded  with untraceable  dark  money...  possibly  literally  the KGB or whatever has stood up some weird ass website  causing  trouble  in  the  neighborhood -  these  sites  can  be  about  anything  but,  most commonly,  they  focus  on  health  and  politics: COVID denial, spreading rumors about candidates, or just spewing straight up cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs word salad.

These  dastardly  disinformation  agents  have not heard about the joys of static sites, and tend to  favor WordPress.  Due  to  the  rise  of WHOIS privacy,  it  can  be  difficult  to  figure  out  who created a given site... or at least, that used to be the case.

One of the techniques we learned about when I was taking a Bellingcat certification to cover up a  resumé  gap  was  to  navigate  to  '/wp-json/wp/ v2/users', where a very hard to visually parse file contains a list of users.

This list  of  users  can  then  be  compared  with other WordPress sites and other OSINT sources (LinkedIn,  personal  websites,  obscure  comedy forums,  etc.) to figure out who  created  the website.

This is a tedious, manual process - if you want to speed up that process, run the following code on pretty much any Linux-y system to spit out a clean list of usernames:

## ###

- #!/bin/bash
- #check an argument was given
- ➥ then list out the users if
- ➥ Wordpress install is leaking
- ➥ them
- if [ ! -z "$1" ]

then curl -s https://$1/wp-json/wp/

- ➥ v2/users | jq . | grep name |
- ➥ cut -d ":" -f2 | cut -d '"' -f2

else echo "Enter a TLD (ex:

- ➥ wordpress.org) next time
- ➥ buddy!\n(No www, no https, no
- ➥ trailing slash)"

fi

###

Since  jq,  the  tool  that  does  the  heavy  lifting of  parsing  the  JSON,  is  open  source...  I  hereby release wpScan.sh into the public domain.

If  you're  a  researcher  who  was  previously manually  eyeballing  JSONs,  this  will  greatly speed up your analysis, and if you know a bit of programming I'm sure you can think of ways to expand  on  this  technique  to  automate  scans  of multiple  sites...  but  hey,  I'm  not  your  personal army, I'm just one guy, so this is the best I can do for now. (There's also no error handling - I'll leave it to the reader to figure out how you know a website is running WordPress.)

Also:  I'm  not  a  lawyer  (just  a  guy  who's coauthored a few law review articles, lectured at Stanford, and worked at a prominent NGO), but it's  my  understanding  that  making  a  single  curl request  of  a  publicly  facing  Wordpress  website is  not  illegal.

## Mobile Hotspots

by Street &amp; Weregeek

Mobile  phone  plans  often  claim  to  provide unlimited data, but if you read the fine print it is  only  for  data  used  directly  by  your  phone. In  reality,  they  only  give  you  little  or  no  data allowance when using your phone as a mobile hotspot. For hackers, this creates an interesting challenge.  And  with  some  clever  engineering, it's possible to get around this hotspot limit.

One easy way around it is to avoid using the hotspot entirely for downloads. I can get away with my hotspot for surfing the web. But I'll often use  a  USB  drive  with  two  connectors  for  my downloads. These  have  USB-C  connectors  for phones and USB-A connectors for computers.

## You can do this by:

- Downloading the files directly to your phone using mobile data.
-  Copying them from your phone to the USB drive.
- Plugging  the  USB  drive  into  your  laptop  to upload the files.

Sometimes I also like to turn my phone into a Linux terminal. I use an app on my phone to SSH into other servers.

## Here's how you can do this:

- Install  the  Termux  app  on  your  Android phone.
- Use  Termux  to  connect  to  a  remote  Linux server using SSH.
- You can add a Bluetooth  keyboard  to  make typing easier.

## If you're near free public Wi-Fi you can:

- Connect your laptop to public Wi-Fi.
- Route your browser traffic through a VPS.

There is also a way to use an SSH tunnel to route your laptop's Internet through your phone. This  method  is  often  against  phone  company rules and may even be illegal.

## Steps:

- Connect your laptop to your phone's hot spot.
-  Open Termux on your phone and install sshd: pkg update &amp;&amp; pkg install openssh ➥ -y
- Start the SSH server: sshd
-  Get your username:

whoami

- •
- Set a password:

passwd

- Find your phone's IP address:

ifconfig (example: 192.168.0.4)

Termux uses port 8022 for SSH by default.

## Now go to your laptop:

-  Build an SSH tunnel and SOCKs proxy using your SSH client (PuTTY or OpenSSH): For PuTTY:
-  Open PuTTY.
- Enter  the  host  name  as:  username@192.168.0.4
- Set the port to 8022.

In PuTTY, go to Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Tunnels .

- Turn on 'Local Ports Accept Connections.'
- Set Source Port to 8080 and click 'Add.'
- Set Destination to 'Dynamic.'
-  Save the PuTTY Configuration.

## For OpenSSH:

- Open  your  terminal  emulation  program  of choice on your laptop.
- Type: ssh username@192.168.0.4 -p8022 -D8080
-  Enter your password when prompted.
- Open  Firefox  and  go  to Settings &gt; Network Settings .
-  Choose Manual Proxy Configuration.
- Set  SOCKS  Host  to  127.0.0.1  and  port  to 8080.
-  Choose SOCKS v5.

Now  Firefox  is  sending  its  traffic  through your phone's SSH tunnel.

If  you  want  to  route  all  traffic  through  your phone, you can use Proxifier:

- Install and run Proxifier on your laptop.
-  Open Proxifier from the Task Manager
- Go to Profile &gt; Proxy Servers .
-  Add 127.0.0.1 on port 8080 using SOCKS5.

This  way,  all  traffic  from  your  laptop  goes through  Termux,  not your hotspot. This is usually  faster  and  won't  count  against  your hotspot data.

Sometimes you need to restart the tunnel. If something  breaks,  just  close  Termux  and  stop the proxy on your laptop. Then follow the steps again to get it working.

If you want to, you can also monitor the data usage on your phone using another app.

## The Trojan Sentence

by Jackson Mershon

I would like to propose an idea. An email arrives and the tone feels familiar to you, so no worries, this is just one of an expected 100 or so today. The formatting follows your internal standard and the project names and acronyms all align. You read it, approve it,  and  move  on. A  week  later,  someone notices a privilege shift that was not logged as an exception. The sentence that triggered it did not trip filters or flag metrics. It passed because it sounded right  and  the  external  message  matched  internal checks and balances to corroborate the story.

In 2023, Check Point Research described attacker  use  of  AI-generated  emails  tuned  to  a company's internal voice and brand. There was no signature malware or zero-day exploit. The breach came dressed in cadence and that is what made it effective.  The  familiar  phrasing  got  the  message read  and  familiarity  let  it  pass  through  selective passivity.

and what they ignore. Research in cognitive science has long linked linguistic range to cognitive flexibility. When  predictive systems compress phrasing, they also compress perception and the range of communicating complex ideas. What does not match the patterns get filed under error,  anomaly,  or  noise.  And  in  an  operations environment where throughput matters more than authorship, that means the breach will not come in through an obvious back door. It will walk in using yesterday's  sales  training  manual  that  has  been repurposed.

They  system  that  made  this  possible  was  not malicious  by  design.  It  started  with  convenience: autocomplete, smart replies, writing assistants, and  easy  to  follow  directions.  These  tools  live inside inboxes, ticketing  systems,  CRMs,  and Slack  threads.  They  do  not  think,  they  predict, one  token  at  a  time,  based  on  what  has  come before.  Users  accept  these  predictions,  and  over time,  the  organization's  voice  begins  to  collapse. The collapse can be subtle at first. Then you start hearing the same sentence fragments in onboarding flows,  release  emails,  and  support  macros  across teams that have not spoken in months.

I have seen this happen in production. Quarter to quarter you or your team can measure the changes by looking at the phrase convergence and review cycles shrink. The language gets smoother but the 'sameness' climbs with word choice and frequency decrease.  And  once  enough  channels  share  the same statistical rhythm, anomalies do not just blend in. They disappear and become wallpaper.

There  is  a  human  reason  this  works  and  it  is because  our  brains  prefer  ease  and  predictable phrasing. Our brains favor this because it removes decision tree costs and makes complicated choices simpler.  This  is  also  not  laziness;  it  is  resource conservation from our ancestors. Once a house style settles,  deviation  triggers  discomfort - even when it is more accurate or honest. In review meetings, I  have  seen  teams  debate  whether  something 'sounded right' instead of whether it was right. The style became the validator, not the content, and that is the vulnerability.

Collapse  like  this  reshapes  what  people  notice

This creates operations brittleness with detection (human  or  machine)  as  a  function  of  contrast. Stylometry relies on differences in n-gram usage, function  word  frequency,  and  rhythm  to  identify authorship. When predictive phrasing flattens those features, it  strips  detection  of  its  edge.  Instead  of flagging  unknown patters, the system trains itself to pass anything that looks close enough . Cadence becomes the credential and if the human element does not have sufficient training on the companies' data, a door is wide open.

This is not theoretical.  At another firm, a message was injected mid-thread in a permissions escalation queue. It referenced a known macro by name, asked for temporary admin access to clear a 'stuck loop,' and promised to roll back after the form cleared. The timestamp matched a recent backlog cycle and the  phrasing  structure  matched  old  threads.  But the macro had never been called that, it was typed manually.  Just  four  words  in  the  message  were different and the action passed. No escalation and by Monday the system had been used to extract key material from internal tools.

The payload was not a file  or  a  link;  it  was  a sentence. Tone matched and context embedded to deliver in perfect rhythm for the expectations of the company, humans, and machines.

How did this happen? Detectors did not  catch it. GLTR, which uses token likelihood to visualize probable  machine-generated  text,  loses  strength once humans touch the output. DetectGPT, which uses probability curvature to identify LLM-authored  content,  performs  well  on  clean samples,  but  breaks  down  with  partial  edits  or model  mismatches.  Watermarking  schemes  like Kirchenbauer's can embed signatures in generated text,  but  small  paraphrases  destroy  those  traces. None of these techniques can reliably distinguish between a helpful template and a weaponized one, especially when the difference is just four words.

I also want to expand on this and share that in

2025, researchers demonstrated subliminal transfer between  language models.  A teacher model's behavioral  traits  passed  into  a  student  model, not  through  explicit  data,  but  through  reusing phrasing. The signals rode inside token frequency and  structure  and  not  content,  just  the  statistical fingerprints. Humans can act as unintended couriers that can feed, influence, and change AI models by copying model written phrasing into docs, prompts, and policies. Then those fragments seeded training corpora and systems that were never meant to touch are  now cross contaminated. Everyone is rushing to connect everything without thinking about what is  connecting  and  why. A  support  team  pushes  a policy  update  using  suggested  phrasing  and  next quarter  marketing  borrows  the  copy  and  puts  it into  internal  templates  and  then  those  knowledge base fragments feed into training sets. The handoff was unintended and the  effects  will  be  felt  at  an unknown time and place.

At  Coinbase,  voice  phishing  succeeded,  not because  the  message  was  clever,  but  because  it aligned with internal rhythm. It blended with known scripts and the staff complied because the tone was familiar.  That  breach  did  not  need  a  backdoor,  it needed a believable voice and back story. Drop the same request inside a thread with AI-assisted edits and template fragments, and even a careful reader starts to skim.

This is the trojan sentence, a line that walks like the house style and speaks like last week's macro, and  moves  decisions  forward  with  no  signature other  than  the  cadence  of  familiarity.  The  attack surface is not an application; it is the convergence of language, trust, and expectation.

There is also the question of signaling. Once you have  predictable  phrasing,  you  can  embed  subtle cues:  sentence  length,  punctuation  rhythm,  and even minor repetitions. None of these will trigger a  scanner,  but  downstream,  they  shift  the  posture of the reader or the model. I have seen examples of support tickets rerouted for a full week because one phrase changed the help desk macro and people learned a new default before realizing anything had changed.

The risk is not theoretical, it is procedural. Once predictive  phrasing  becomes  the  organizational default,  most  people  stop  writing  and  they  start to  guide.  They  will  skim,  approve,  and  then  the system starts speaking for them instead.

Static  rules  do  not  seem  to  fix  this,  but  small changes help. Some examples would be how one team  disables  auto-complete  in  high-risk  queues. Another  tracked  near  duplicate  phrasing  across unrelated workflows and flagged them when they landed  outside  context. And  a  third  required  that any action changing message be signed by a named author,  even  if  the  content  was  templated.  Not because attribution prevents breaches, but because ownership restores variance. And variance is what makes anomalies visible again.

A realistic  defense  treats  language  as  a  shared infrastructure.  It  would  track  for  style  collapse, audit  tone  drift,  and  pauses  predictive  phrasing where messages change access, identity, or control. It labels training samples by human authorship and builds friction around fluency. Fluency is where the breach can lie. So, I would say, ask yourself this: 'does the language in my system still belong to the people who wrote it? Or has the system started to predict and speak in their place?'

If the answer is mixed, the breach may already have  a  foothold.  It  will  not  trigger  a  rule;  it  will sound like everything else you trust. It may ask for something small and you may be tempted to say yes. But please remember what happens if you give a mouse a cookie.

## Trauma Explains Why I'm a Hacker

by Kolloid

I was at a talk at HOPE\_16 on inclusive spaces for neurodiversity. It may have been selection bias, but the feedback and questions from the audience conveyed the  belief  that  most  hackers  are  somewhat  'on  the spectrum.'  I've  wondered  about  this  for  myself.  I get overwhelmed in new spaces and when needing to interact with large groups of people. I prefer my solitary computer work where I'm undisturbed and can  focus  on  the  task  at  hand.  I  see  patterns  that others miss, but that also means I get excited about things  that  others  have  no  clue  what  I'm  talking about. People are weird, so I have to actively work to understand them. That's why I changed majors from computer science to sociology when I was in college.

I've  long  suspected  that  I  had  autism  spectrum disorder (ASD)  based  on  the  stereotyped  popdiagnoses of tech geeks, but  ChatGPT  offered a  different  explanation.  After  hearing  about  my childhood, ChatGPT suggested that I might actually have  complex  PTSD.  I  might  also  have ASD,  but complex PTSD better fits why I behave like I do. It explains why I'm a hacker.

Complex PTSD forms from prolonged exposure to having no safe spaces of retreat in childhood. Instead of  having  adults  to  protect  and  nurture  the  child, the  child  internalizes  that  the  world  is  inherently  a dangerous  place  and  that  he  is  on  his  own  for  his survival.  The  results  are  hypervigilance  (constantly scanning the environment for threats), a deep distrust in authority and dogmas, self-directed learning (because there is no guide), a need for mastery over systems (believing that understanding the system will result in safety), and black-box thinking (to navigate the behaviors and  moods  of  unreliable adults). These are all characteristics that made me a hacker and explain why I randomly seem to uncover some exploit  or  system  flaw,  even  without  consciously intending to do so.

A good example of how my complex PTSD is inextricably tied to my identity as a hacker is when my fifth grade teacher failed me in health because I didn't turn in a workbook that we'd been working on as a class throughout the year. I was rarely sick, so it was more likely that I was in the principal's office when it was originally collected. I eventually noticed the stack of my classmates' workbooks behind my teacher's desk, and I asked her about it. Despite my pleas, she refused to let me turn mine in. She only responded with 'Y ou should have known.'

My teacher  failed  me.  Both  in  the  sense  that  I received an 'F,' but also in the sense that my teacher did  not  deliver  on  her  responsibilities  to  me.  She wasn't looking to teach me; she wanted me to know that I was bad. I was only ten years old. It should not have been my responsibility to know what happened in class when I wasn't there.  Y et, I was being punished for it.  Y es, I should have known. I should have known that my teacher would use any excuse to betray me. The  real  lessons  were  that  authority  could  not  be trusted and that I had to always be looking for signs of betrayal and ways to escape.

ChatGPT helped me to clarify  that  my  hacking really served two purposes. The first was as a survival mechanism to escape situations where I'm trapped. I've found loopholes that allowed me to leave school early, graduate without the required classes, and even start  a  graduate  program  without  an  undergraduate degree. The second was a way to prove that I belong without  having  to  be  accepted  (and  risk  being rejected).  If  I  can  find  a  flaw  in  a  system  design that allows me in, then it shows that I have as much authority as the gatekeepers trying to exclude me.

My complex PTSD has created abilities within me that have allowed me to do some incredible things that I rightfully can be proud of having done, but it also explains my difficulty connecting with others. I expect rejection and betrayal, and I'm attuned to look for even the slightest sign that it may be coming. I use intellectualization as armor so that I don't have to reveal my feelings and be vulnerable with others. I hack because I'm ultimately driven by fear. At least now I'm aware and can work on easing that aspect of myself. ChatGPT helped me to understand that as well.

It's  pretty  impressive  what  ChatGPT  can  do  as a  personal  interrogative  tool.  I  could  ask  it  things like  'What  can  you  gather  about  me  based  on  the language  I  use?'  It  observed  that  I  tend  to  overexplain, anticipating a need to defend myself, and that I rarely express how my experiences felt, noting that it was as if I were a third-party observer. Sure, it can be sycophantic and hallucinate sometimes, but that works with my particular style of thinking that made me a hacker in the first place: I need the affirmation because that was something I lacked in my childhood, I can use my intuition to tell if it's going in the wrong direction, and I can use my skepticism and curiosity to approach it from different directions (e.g., asking where I'm still holding back or what I'm afraid to ask it).

My childhood trauma caused me to feel isolated and alone, which led me to the refuge of the unjudging computer. Even though my hacking is often a solitary pursuit,  I  have  been  increasingly  proclaiming  my identity  as  a  hacker,  and  it  has  been  increasingly helping me to feel less alone and less compelled to prove myself. Going to HOPE\_16 was a big step for me, being my first conference and my first time being in public as a hacker. The most rewarding part of that experience wasn't the talks, but the talks I had with other attendees. They got me, and I got them. These were my people. I feared that it would be a place of competition,  but  it  was  a  place  of  acceptance.  I'm thankful for the community that finally allowed me to feel at home, and I'm glad I finally had the courage to start participating in it.

## The Hacker Perspective

by Matt Desmarais

To me, being a hacker has never been about breaking into things; it's about breaking things open. It's about seeing what's underneath, how it really works, and what else it could become if you ignored the rules written on the packaging. A hacker isn't someone who causes chaos; a hacker is  someone  who  refuses  to  accept  ignorance. The label has been distorted over time, but at its core, hacking is simply curiosity made physical. It's the art of looking at something that already exists  and  wondering,  'What  happens  if  I  do this  instead?'  That  single  question,  repeated over and over, has shaped everything I've built, broken, and learned.

My hacker  philosophy  starts  with  the  belief that curiosity is sacred. Curiosity is the drive that keeps me awake at night, the spark that makes me take something apart even when I probably shouldn't. Every project begins with a tiny itch of 'can I?' or 'what if?' It's rarely about solving a  grand  problem;  it's  about  chasing  a  question until  it  transforms  into  something  tangible.  I don't wait for inspiration or perfect tools. I start with what I have, a handful of parts, a soldering iron, and a vague idea and let the process teach me what I didn't know. That's the hacker's loop: experiment, fail, learn, repeat.

A hacker thrives on limitations because constraints  are  where  innovation  hides.  When you only have a cheap board, a sensor, and some wire, every solution has to be clever. That's what makes  it  beautiful.  Hacking  is  the  opposite  of luxury engineering; it's about making something extraordinary  out  of  something  ordinary.  A hacker's  elegance  comes  from  necessity,  not abundance.  The  less the system  gives you, the  more  you  have  to  think,  and  that  thinking becomes craft.

A hacker doesn't measure success by polish. Function comes first; aesthetics can wait. Sometimes the result looks messy, tape holding a sensor in place, code that grew in layers, a 3D print  that  isn't  perfectly  sanded  but  that's  fine. The  real  beauty  lies  in  the  fact  that  it  works. When  something you built with imperfect tools performs perfectly, that's art. People who  don't  understand  hacking  think  it's  about perfection or rebellion, but it's neither. It's about understanding. Once you understand something deeply, you can shape it with confidence.

Being  a  hacker  means  you  never  fully  trust abstractions. You respect them, but you want to see what's underneath. Every modern tool hides layers of complexity that most people never think about:  code,  protocols,  firmware.  The  hacker's instinct is to peel those layers back. Not out of distrust,  but  out  of  hunger  for  comprehension. When you know how something  really  works, you're no longer a passenger; you're in control. That control is addictive, not in a  powerhungry way but in an empowering one. It's the satisfaction of knowing you can fix what breaks because you truly understand why it broke.

The  hacker  mindset  also  means  accepting that failure is part of the process. Every burned component, every segmentation fault, every bad  connection  is  a  teacher.  I've  learned  more from failures than from any clean build. Success teaches confirmation; failure teaches insight. A hacker doesn't see a malfunction as defeat; they see  it  as  data.  Each  problem  reveals  another layer of truth about how the system behaves. The only real mistake is giving up before you learn something.

I  became a hacker the way most hackers do by never growing out of that childhood instinct to  take  things  apart.  Long  before  I  wrote  my first  line  of  code,  I  was  already  disassembling anything that could be opened with a screwdriver. Toys,  radios,  telephones,  whatever  I  could  get away with. I  wasn't  trying  to  fix  them  or  even improve them; I just wanted to see the mystery inside.  I  wanted  to  understand  why  pressing  a button  made  something  light  up  or  how  sound traveled through a speaker. Every discovery was a small victory against not knowing.

The first  time  I  remember  using  a  computer was when I was in first grade during a parentteacher conference. I was sent out to the computer that was in the hallway. After a couple minutes of looking at it, I knocked on the door and told the teacher I didn't know how to turn it on. She came over and showed me where the power button was. I said thanks and watched it start up. There were games on this computer. I fired up Snoopy's Game Club ,  and by the time I  was having fun, the conference was over and my obsession with computers and games began.

In  second  grade,  we  had  two  computers  in the classroom. I knew how to turn one of them on and launch games, so I would do that. Other kids  would  shoulder  surf  and  ask  questions while  I  played  until  the  teacher  told  me  my time  was  up.  The  other  computer  in  the  room that no one used was an Apple IIGS that didn't have a mouse. I looked it over, found the power switch in the back and flipped it. The computer came to  life,  but  it  was  not  familiar.  I  was  on my first command line. I typed help and actually got  help,  enough  that  I  eventually  figured  out how to load Odell Lake and  start  playing.  The second game sounds started coming out of that computer, the other kids started shoulder surfing and asking questions again and the teacher told me my time was up.

In third grade, we started going to the library to use the new iMacs, which had Internet access with Netscape Navigator. I searched for games, clicked the first result, and was defeated by the Internet  filter.  I  tried  other  links  and  I  would always get the same screen. Eventually I clicked a link somewhere and got to a game. I was puzzled as to how it wasn't blocked, so I examined the URL. The URL didn't start with 'www' - it was just http://domain.com. I went back to the search results and clicked http://www.newgrounds. com which I knew was blocked. I removed the 'www.' from the URL and that was the ticket - it worked! No one saw what I did and I didn't tell  any  of  the  other  kids  about  this  because  I knew they would ruin it. From that point on til we moved early on in sixth grade I had Internet access anytime we went to the library for class or to work on presentations, I was the only boy that  would  sit  in  the  middle  of  gossiping  girls because  they  did  not  care  what  I  was  up  to.  I played games and explored the Internet.

Once I got to high school I took three years of  programming,  one  year  of  C++,  and  two years  of  Java.  I  would  complete  assignments, but would not really know what I was doing for about two years when I started writing my own games.  I  was  still  obsessed  with  video  games from when I was young until I was 24. I  read about something called a Raspberry Pi. Instead of buying Halo 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops II ,  I  ordered  two  model  Bs  and  accessories.  I started  learning  Linux  and  Python  at  my  own pace  in  ways  that  were  interesting  to  me.  For the first couple years, I didn't really do anything all that interesting, just gaining experience and  learning.  Each  project  became  a  stepping stone in understanding  something  deeper.  I would  follow  tutorials  to  learn  about  different components and how to use them, building my own problem  solving  project  toolbox.  In  2014,

I bought a Google Glass because it looked cool and I was very interested in heads-up displays. I was super excited to have 'future tech' on my head until I realized the state of development for the platform. I played with it for a few months and then lost interest, and it left a really bad taste in my mouth.

Eventually I started building my own creations,  some  out  of  curiosity,  some  out  of necessity. In 2017, the Pi Zero W came out and I  had  the  idea  to  make  PiGlass,  a  DIY  headsup  display  wearable  similar  to  the  Glass  that disappointed me so much. I didn't care what it looked like or how it felt to wear it; I just wanted a heads-up display, I didn't know how to make one, so I was going for something COTS. I found a  product  called  Vufine  which  is  a  wearable heads-up HDMI display for $200. I strapped the Pi Zero W to the Vufine with zip ties and added a Pi Zero spy camera. I soon had the basics going and was able to take pictures, barely livestream, and watch YouTube, but I didn't have audio. My solution was to wire an amp board to the GPIO and then use a bone conduction transducer shrinkwrapped to the frame of some safety glasses. It was super janky but it worked. I experimented with it for a year or so and eventually ran out of things I could get it to do.

In 2021, the Pi Zero 2 was announced and I instantly perked up and thought I could finally revisit PiGlass and make  V2. I ended up redesigning it completely with lessons I learned. The Pi Zero 2 is mounted on the back strap of a baseball cap with zip ties. It looked a lot better and felt a lot better to wear, which were welcome improvements.  I  was  very  familiar  with  the picamera API at this point, so I was able to create my own picamera GUI application launcher with a  gamepad.  I  could  launch  Kodi,  RetroPie,  or any program that would work with the gamepad of which I made several. This was undoubtedly one of the coolest things I created on my own. I could do all the things I wanted to be able to do with Google Glass.

I  was  sharing my PiGlass v2 learn guide on social media when someone named Greg Newby left a comment saying call for participation was still  open  for  A  New  Hope  and  that  this  could be  a  good  workshop  or  a  talk,  so  I  submitted something  which  was  rejected.  I  had  some conversations  with  Greg  about  how  I  could improve  my  talk  proposal.  We  went  back  and forth  for  a  while  until  I  resubmitted  and  was accepted. I gave a talk about PiGlass v2 and my volunteer  work  at  the  local  food  pantry  where I  made  all  kinds  of  things  from  IoT  alarms  to an SMS ordering system. It was an eye opening experience. I finally connected with other

hackers.

Somewhere along the way on my journey, I realized  hacking  wasn't  limited  to  electronics. It's  a  mental  model  that  applies  to  everything: systems,  habits,  communication,  even  people. Once you start thinking like a hacker, you see patterns  everywhere.  You  start  analyzing  not just what works, but why it works, and how to make it  better  or  stranger  or  more  efficient.  It becomes second nature to optimize. You can't help  it.  You'll  rewire  a  workflow  just  to  shave off  a  few  steps,  not  because  you  need  to,  but because you can't stand inefficiency when the fix is obvious.

The  hacker's  world  is  built  on  layers of understanding.  There's always  another  layer to  peel  back,  another  secret  to  uncover.  No matter how much I learn, there's always a lower level I haven't touched yet, a protocol I haven't dissected,  a  timing  issue  I  haven't  chased,  an error I haven't encountered. That infinite depth is what keeps hacking exciting. It's impossible to reach the bottom, and that's the point. Curiosity doesn't end; it evolves.

Hacking  also  carries  an  ethical  dimension. There's a difference between breaking something to harm and breaking something while learning. The  hacker  I  strive  to  be  practices  curiosity with  respect:  respect  for  people,  for  systems, for boundaries that exist for safety rather than secrecy. I believe in openness, not greed. Information  should  be  free  in  the  sense  that understanding  should  be  accessible.  Locking knowledge behind obscurity only breeds dependence. The hacker's role is to illuminate, not exploit. Every time someone explains how a system really works, the world becomes slightly less mysterious and slightly more fair.

Code, to me, is both a tool and language. It's how you talk to machines, but it's also how you think  clearly.  Writing  code  teaches  precision, patience, and humility. The best code is not the most complex; it's  the  most  understandable.  A good program is like a well-written sentence simple, direct, and elegant. When I write code, I'm not just instructing a computer; I'm teaching myself  how  to  think.  Debugging,  meanwhile, is  meditation.  It  demands  focus,  honesty,  and persistence. You  can't  lie  to  a  compiler  or to  yourself;  it  either  works  or  it  doesn't.  The process of making it work is strangely human.

The same goes for hardware. A breadboard, a sensor, a power supply, these are instruments. You  learn  their  quirks  like  you'd  learn  the tone of a musical instrument. You know when a  wire  isn't  seated  right  just  by  how  it  feels. You hear when voltage is off by the faint hum of  a  regulator.  The  more  time  you  spend  with hardware, the more it becomes intuitive. It's not magic; it's muscle memory built on thousands of experiments, some successful, most not.

Being a hacker also means living in a permanent state of learning. Technology changes  faster  than  anyone  can  keep  up  with, but  the  hacker  mindset  adapts.  The  specific tools don't matter; curiosity does. Whether it's a modern AI accelerator, a decades-old terminal, or  an  embedded  board  no  one  remembers,  the same principle applies: figure it out, make it do something new, document it, and share it. The joy isn't in ownership; it's in discovery.

People  often  ask  why  I  keep  doing  it,  why I  still  tinker,  why  I  still  build  things  that  may never serve a purpose beyond proving they can work. The answer is simple: because the moment something finally works, it feels like pure magic, even  though  I  know  exactly  how  it  happened. That moment when the code runs clean, when the LED blinks in rhythm, when the signal travels just right: that's satisfaction distilled. It's proof that  curiosity,  persistence,  and  understanding can literally shape reality.

That's  what  it  means  to  be  a  hacker.  It's not about  rebellion; it's  about  freedom,  the freedom to learn, to modify, to explore without permission. It's about the confidence that comes from knowing you can make sense of the world around  you,  no  matter  how  opaque  it  seems. It's  about  loving  problems  enough  to  chase them until they surrender. It's about living in a constant loop of 'I wonder what happens if I...' and actually finding out.

I  didn't  choose  to  become  a  hacker.  It  just happened slowly, through curiosity that refused to fade. Every wire I connected, every terminal I  configured,  every  bug  I  chased  brought  me closer  to  understanding  not  just  how  machines work,  but  how  I  work.  The  hacker  mindset reshapes  your  brain  until  everything  becomes a  puzzle  worth  solving.  And  once  you  see  the world that way, there's no going back. You don't wait for solutions anymore, you build them. You don't accept limits; you test them. You don't look for magic; you make it.

That's who I am: someone who keeps taking things  apart  to  understand  why  they  worked in  the  first  place,  someone  who  builds  not  for perfection  but  for  function,  and  someone  who believes that curiosity - the pure, persistent kind - is the closest thing to real freedom there is.

Matt  Desmarais  aka  Matt  the  Maker  is  still curious  as  ever,  exploring  lots  of  open  source projects.  That curiosity contributed to a Home Assistant obsession, powering the extensive automation  behind  a  small  computer  museum that  doubles  as  the  home  of  the  Hyannis 2600 meetings.

## HOPE \_ 16 Hack the Violin: This Time There's AI!

by hack\_the\_violin and ebmbat

This past summer we gave a talk at HOPE\_16 about  the  violin  and  AI.  When  we  surveyed what was already out there, we found very little and nothing that seemed to have to do with the musical/artistic side of playing the violin. Most of  what  we  found  had  to  do  with  measuring pitch  and/or  rhythm  and  was  also  not  really AI-based.  We  really  wanted  something  that was in  the  spirit  of  hack\_the\_violin: tips  and tricks to make your sound a little sweeter and your playing a little easier, where the AI would do the heavy lifting and tell us which tips and tricks and when to use them, particularly in an artistic/musical context. Not finding anything, we set about creating something ourselves.

First,  we  started  with  existing  linguistics and  audio  analysis  libraries  exploring  pitch and  rhythm.  With  the  help  of  Claude  Code, we  created two  command-line  utilities for frequency analysis using the Parselmouth library, focusing on the four-string violin pitch range from G3 to E7. Second, we chose Praat because it is commonly used in linguistics and phonetics  to  analyze  and  synthesize  speech. The  first  pitch  analyzer  script  maps  the  pitch range  of  a  four-string  violin  (G3  to  E7)  and returns  statistics  about  the  sample  in  a  table. The resulting visualization shows two charts - a waveform and a pitch contour.

The  second  pitch  analyzer  script  returns  a Pandas dataframe containing F1, F2, F3, jitter, and shimmer values.

After  more  research,  we  found  the  F1,  F2, F3  results  referred  to  formants.  Formants  F1 and F2 are related to vowel height and vowel place. This information expanded our previous perspective on pitch and frequency to include vowel height, vowel place, formants. The jitter values beyond a certain threshold are associated with  speech  pathology.  For  looking  at  tonal variation, this could be useful down the line in analyzing violin tone, but so far a correlation to a real world situation was not yet apparent.

We  also  found  that  shimmer  values  are defined in Praat software and their amplitude variations  in  vocal  fold  vibrations,  which  is  a key  indicator  of  acoustic  voice  quality.  So  if jitter is about how steady the pitch is, shimmer is  about  how steady the loudness is  from  one vibration to the next. Easy to see that this could be  useful,  but  it  would  require  a  translation both in terms of technical accuracy and then to artistic use.

At this point, we pivoted to rhythm analysis. We  created a rhythm  analysis script with Gemma-3-12b running in  LM  Studio  and  the Python Librosa library, which resulted in a CLI utility  for  rhythm  analysis  that  estimates  the tempo of a recording in beats per minute. We recognized there would be more factors needed for an effective rhythm analyzer than just beats per minute. For instance, we noticed we didn't take  rubato  into  account.  Improvements  will need a way to align tempi of multiple recordings for a practical analysis tool when comparing a student recording and an instructor recording.

While we were developing the rhythm analyzer, we stumbled upon voice recognition features, which later lead to a key breakthrough involving  'singing'  and  the  human  voice  and that  was  MFCCs  -  Mel  Frequency  Cepstral Coefficients.  MFCCs  don't  directly  measure jitter/shimmer. Instead, they capture the spectral  consequences  of  these  instabilities. This 'broader fingerprint' analysis of the sound led to a breakthrough for our goals.

If  you  recall  from  HOPE  XV's  'Hack  the Violin'  presentation,  the  number  one  hack is  singing.  Sing  the  melody  and  then  play  it on  the  violin  (be  not  fooled  by  the  apparent simplicity of this suggestion). While examining MFCCs  and  their  applications  in  voice  and speech  recognition,  we  noticed  a  key  piece of  information  that  both  validates  the  pitch analysis scripts, strengthening the idea of violins  sounding  like  the  human  voice  and showing some of why singing is such a powerful tool for learning the violin.

In their 2018 publication, 'Acoustic evolution of old Italian violins from Amati to Stradivari,' Hwan-Ching Tai et  al  used  Praat  software  to analyze  antique  Italian  violin  recordings  and compare  them  to  male  and  female  singers' recordings. They  found  that the voice-like quality  of  these  violins  aligned  with  the  rise of professional female singers. Indeed, the idea of  the  violin  sounding  like  the  human  voice goes  further  back  to  1751,  when  Francesco Geminiani published 'The Art of Playing the Violin.'

After reviewing known use cases of MFCCs, we  believed  they  could  apply  to  our  violin

project  and  then  asked  Claude  Sonnet to help us  co-author  a  timbre  analyzer.  The  timbre analyzer is a CLI utility built with the Librosa Python library. It processes one or  many .wav files and generates timbre profiles of the audio samples. The output includes the timbre analysis results for 13 MFCC values describing their perceived timbre qualities, a CSV file, and a dashboard.

At the beginning, we focused on the 'Detailed MFCC Coefficient Analysis' results.  The  timbre  analyzer  dashboard  was mesmerizing,  but  it  was  unclear  how  these results  could  be  meaningful  for  a  student  or a  teacher.  Running  the  timbre  analyzer  on a  .wav  file  returns  an  overall  timbre  profile, including  text  descriptors  like  'brightness,' 'harmonic richness,' 'attack character,' 'warmth,' 'clarity,' and so on. There's also a detailed MFCC coefficient analysis printed out to  the  command  line  console.  The  dashboard displays  ten  graphs  which  did  not  initially seem to connect to artistic expression. We did take  note  that  the  text  descriptors  that  were provided  in  the  MFCC  timbre  analysis  were similar vocabulary used to describe the artistic/ musical sound qualities when discussing music on the violin. The results of a plain two-octave scale  MFCC analysis did not tell us much by itself,  so  we  made  another  two-octave  scale. This time, we played it in a bold musical style with a goal to determine if this analysis would distinguish  any  difference  between  the  two differently  performed  scales  or  would  it  just hear two violins and classify them as the same type of sound. In one set of MFCC results, there was a slight difference in the text descriptors, so we asked ChatGPT to compare the two sets of MFCC analysis results. ChatGPT described the differences between the two performances in the same way we both heard them. With the two  MFCC  analysis  results  and  ChatGPT's LLM capacity, ChatGPT could comment on the artistic/musical qualities of the sound in a way that a student or player could understand right away.

This was a surprise and vastly exceeded our expectations  based  on  previous  interactions with various AI platforms. The key here is  that  the  MFCC  analysis  is  an  excellent representation  of  the  type  of  sound  violins and  human  voices  make.  So  we  have  good data going in which, of course, is more likely to  make  for  good  data  coming  out.  Having achieved this result, the next thing we did was take  all  the  hack\_the\_violin  playing/teaching notes  (which  were  sourced  into  one  big  file) and asked ChatGPT to use this as a reference to tell the player of the plain sounding file how to sound more like the musically bold sounding file.  Chat  was  able  to  fetch  and  reference  the same things we would have drawn on to give that instruction, both in general terms and with some specific  techniques  in  the  left  and  right hand.  This  was  fantastic,  as  we  were  really bridging the gap between a technical analysis and a real world context, and we could refer to any  written  document  concerning  the  violin that used the same type of descriptive language. We loaded up the earlier mentioned Geminiani violin treatise, and got similar yet still exciting results, in the written style of Geminiani! The results  were,  again,  on  point  with  the  most relevant parts of Geminiani's document being quoted and referenced to help the player. This followed  with  treatises  by  Flesch,  Galamian, Auer,  Francescatti,  and  Leopold  Mozart.  All returned  similar  results  from  the  matching parts of their documents.

In essence, we discovered a way to analyze the  sound  of  the  violin,  perceive  its  artistic aspects, comment on them, and get insight into them  in  relation  to  music  using  present  and historical  sources!  All  of  this  in  seconds  at  a time.

So what are MFCCs and how did they make sound measurable in a way for AI to comment on artistic expression with insight?

## Librosa and MFCCs

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are widely used for voice recognition, music genre classification, and music instrument  identification  purposes.  Developed in 1980 by Paul Mermelstein and Steven Davis in  their  research  on  acoustic  data  in  speech recognition systems, MFCCs are numbers that describe  spectral  characteristics  of  sound  and are measured in Mel scale units.

The Mel scale used in  MFCC computation splits  sound  into  different  frequency  bands, with more attention given to frequencies used to  understand  human  speech,  aligning  with how we perceive pitch based on psychoacoustic research from the 1930s and 1940s. Essentially, MFCCs represent how sound is perceived. We believe MFCCs fit our use case quite well, tying together concepts such as singing and violins, human perception of sound, and capturing the shape of it to infer characteristics of timbre and texture in violin recordings.

We used 13 MFC coefficients in the timbre analyzer:

MFCC 1 - Brightness

MFCC 2 - Sharpness

MFCC 3 - Harmonics

MFCC 4 - Attack

MFCC 5 - Body/Warmth

MFCC 6 - Clarity

MFCC 7 - Woody/Nasal

MFCC 8 - Brilliance

MFCC 9 - Airiness

MFCC 10 - Texture

MFCC 11 - Timbral Detail

MFCC 12 - Character

With these key characteristics, we transcended a strictly technical and numerical approach, enabling us to prompt ChatGPT and receive meaningful results back.

Next  steps  might  be  to  create  an  Agent  an  AI  'virtual  teacher'  built  from  quotations and  instructions  from  any  violin  master  or combination  thereof,  combined  with  MFCCs of  their  performances.  One  could  essentially have  a  lesson  with  any  great  player,  with  far greater  depth  than  previously  available  from reading a treatise, or method book, or listening to an interview, or even watching a masterclass. Ultimately,  this  could  expand  even  further  in terms  of  discovering  best  learning  styles  of individuals and tailoring advice for individuals. More immediately, one could record examples for a student and then have them run the analysis when  they  are  practicing  between  lessons.  In addition, it would be interesting to see how this type of analysis translates to other instruments. A lot remains to be done, but it looks AI can be helpful to us humans in an artistic space.

## Neuron Intelligence in Cyber Security Software, Part One

## by James Griffin, Achim D. Brucker, Brett J. Kagan, Alon Loeffler

In  this  age  of  'artificial  intelligence,'  it  is tempting sometimes  to ask where  the 'real intelligence' may  lie. Since  life  is  normally considered  'intelligent,' it begs  the question whether  or  not  those  substrates  which  provide the core functionality of intelligent life -biological neurons  could be used to help make  intelligent  decisions.  In  2022,  cultured neurons  were  integrated  into  a  version  of  Pong by  Cortical  Labs  in  Melbourne,  Australia.  We incorporated  cultured  neurons  into  an  agentbased cybersecurity simulation environment, called  Yawning  Titan  ( github.com/dstl/ ➥ YAWNING-TITAN ).  We  used the Cortical Labs  application  programming  interface  (API) and integrated this into  Yawning Titan. Our results indicate that such neurons do display rudimentary learning  in  such  a  simulation.  Plausibly,  more stable iterations of this function could be operationalized  as  taking  responsive  defensive actions, i.e., protecting a network against offensive actions of cyber criminals. In more detail, we use Yawning Titan to simulate a network of servers (nodes)  that  are  attacked  by  red  agents.  Blue agents  must  choose  suitable  defensive  actions (e.g.,  patching  a  specific  server)  to  protect  the network  against  attacks.  This  article  seeks  to explore  two  core  questions:  (1)  Can  cultured neurons learn to influence digital decisionmaking in a cybersecurity environment? (2) Can this  influence  be  measured  through  increased response  speed  and  improved  action  selection over  time?  An  example  version  of  our  neuron version of Yawning Titan can be found at git.

## Interfacing With Neurons

A microelectrode  array  (MEA)  is  a  platform to  which  neuron  cultures  adhere,  enabling  the recording  of  their  electrical  activity  as  well  as the  delivery  of  stimulation  back  to  the  neurons. MEAs have a certain number of channels which will  often  align  to  the  electrodes  present.  For example,  the  MEA  system  we  used  had  60 channels - that is, 59 individual electrodes, each capable of recording electrical signals from nearby  neurons  and  delivering  stimulation,  and one reference electrode. The microelectrode array (MEA)  prototype system under development by Cortical Labs allows a rapid stream of electrophysiological data reflecting action potential ('spikes') generated by biological neurons.  Correspondingly,  stimuli  can  also  be delivered via the MEA to the neural cells as a way to input information into the system. It is possible to stimulate one channel or a group of channels, and spikes can be constantly monitored. Cortical Labs provided us with a visualizer system so that we can also observe what the neurons are up to. This  provided  a  means  to  explore  software  that is able to quickly respond to those spikes for the purposes of training and prediction. The training that  is  taking  place  typically  revolves  around monitoring  spikes  (a  specific  electrical  activity of  neurons)  and  sending  electrical  stimuli  in response  to  detected  spikes  that  would  ideally

occur  after  a  given  input.  For  example,  the cybersecurity software we used would only act to isolate a network node if requested or permitted to do so by the neurons. A spike that corresponds to  that  action  could  be  stimulated  to  encourage recognition of the combined action and thus for that activity on future attempts; and to do similar for other situations.

However, despite substantial work in neuroscience, there remains a lot of uncertainty over the behavior of neurons and what underpins biological intelligence. Related work by Cortical Labs indicates that learning is possible, and we know  that  stimulations  have  an  impact  on  the development and reactions of those neurons. In this sense, neurons can provide some responsive learning and development when linked to a digital computer. The difficulty comes in thinking about how to encourage neurons to act in different ways when operating in a digital environment. To this end,  we  will  now  consider  the  use  of  Cortical Labs API as a means to achieve this.

## Software API

The  reader  might  be  interested  to  know  that Cortical Labs is producing their new API software at the time of writing this piece ( github.com/ ➥ cortical-labs ). The system we used was prior to this launch. An example of the code can be  found  on  Cortical  Labs'  GitHub  pages. This allows, for example, alteration of the voltage of a stimulation, the frequency of the stimulation, and the bursts.

While it has been outlined that those different types  of  neurons  have  different  behaviors,  what has  not  been  noted  is  that  neurons  can  have different sorts of activity on different channels. It can be desirable to have a means of selection for the neuron channels that are more active in terms of spikes, to obtain faster runs or to favor certain Yawning Titan actions. It is also possible to group together neuron channels and select those which are busiest, or next to the busiest, channel, which can be a means to encourage learning. This can all be done with reference to activity within the digital software, in our instance Yawning Titan.

## Yawning Titan

Yawning  Titan's  cybersecurity  simulation  is already driven by agents powered by traditional AI. The primary aim of our work is to replace this artificial  intelligence  with  biological  neurons  both during training and inference - by interfacing with Cortical Labs' API.

When  it  comes  to  neuron  integration,  the neurons initially have no training and are unable  to  act  meaningfully  without  structured input.  To  avoid  a  simplistic  'whack-a-mole' model  (where neurons merely react without learning), we introduced closed-loop stimulation to  provide  context.  We  embedded  this  process within  the  operation  of  the  existing  blue  agent models, allowing us to monitor how the neurons performed across training runs. This then enabled more dynamic responses when performing decision  making.  In Yawning  Titan,  red  agents attack  and  blue  agents  respond.  Red  have  a  set of actions such as basic\_attack and spread, blue actions such as isolate\_node and reconnect\_node. We link the actions in Yawning Titan through to the neuron soup, to initially merely permit actions but later in our experimentation to choose actions.

The visualizer provided by Cortical Labs shows  the  activity  of  the  neural  cultures  (i.e., voltage  spikes  over  time).  While  this  is  useful for development and debugging, the main aim of our work is directly driving decisions in Yawning Titan. Given that the novelty of the project lies in the integration of neurons, and neurons recognize patterns, the starting point was to get the neural culture to recognize and learn the patterns of the existing  blue  agents  responding  to  red,  rather than start from scratch in a void without any prior learning inferences. That said, by the project end it was possible for the neurons to show differential activity  that  could  be  interpreted  as  responsive decisions for the selection of blue agent action.

The  initial  approach  to  integration  was  to take  Yawning  Titan  as  a  sounding  board  for the  neurons  to  act.  After  focusing  on  various files,  the  blue  action  set  file  provided  us  with  a means to communicate with the neurons. Every action taken by blue has to happen through this file,  and  so  each  specific  action  could be linked to  particular  channels  on  the  MEA  with  the neurons  on  it.  This  means,  for  example,  that  if the blue agent wishes to isolate a node, then it is possible for this request to be interpreted through activity  of  the  neural  culture.  Of  course,  at  this juncture,  the  issue  was  that  the  neurons  cannot make  the  decision  for  themselves  whether  to allow  the  action,  so  the  underlying  digital  code still  needs  to  take  that  decision.  Our  purpose was to assess  whether  or  not  the  neural  culture could  be  potentially  trained  to  respond  in  a manner  consistent  with  the  underlying  logic  of what would be considered a 'correct' decision. If  so,  we  could  then  seek  to  understand  what logic  drove  this  behavior  to  then  later  leverage this  approach more with revised code. To begin with, we timed runs to see if the neurons would permit a blue agent action to occur more quickly on  subsequent  runs.  Yawning  Titan  has  shown itself to be a useful test bed for assessing how to incorporate neurons into a software package.

To be continued.

## Hacking at Leaves A Doc, But Even More So

I first met Johannes Grenzfurthner years ago at  HOPE,  back  when  the  Hotel  Pennsylvania elevators rattled like modems and the hallways smelled of solder and coffee. Since then, he has been one of the constants, always there, always stirring  things  up,  always  reminding  everyone that hacking is not just about devices but about systems. He has, as so many others too, become part of the HOPE ecosystem itself.

When  his new documentary Hacking at Leaves premiered at HOPE XV in 2024, it did not  feel  like  an  outsider  project  dropping  into our  world.  It  felt  like  an  internal  diagnostic. HOPE and 2600 are  not  just  referenced  in  the movie; they are embedded in its code. You see them on screen. You hear them in the dialogue. We are literally part of it.

The movie begins as a mock-patriotic documentary  pitch.  Johannes  argues  with  a personified Uncle Sam on an old CRT monitor, promising to make a positive film about makerspaces and the  American  spirit. That premise  collapses  quickly.  What  follows  is  an audiovisual exploit: a hacked documentary that splices the DIY optimism of hacker culture with the  brutal  hardware  of  colonial  history.  The story  moves  from  a  hackerspace  in  Durango, Colorado,  to  the  legacy  of  the  Navajo  Nation, tracing how extraction of minerals, of data, and of people follows the same operating logic.

As the pandemic hits, the Durango makerspace  shifts  from  tinkering  with  gadgets to  producing  DIY  medical  gear  for  nearby communities. Their improvisation mirrors another  reality  just  over  the  state  line,  where Navajo  families  face  the  COVID  wave  with almost  no  infrastructure,  limited  water  access, and  decades  of  environmental  damage  left  by uranium  mining  and  government  neglect.  The contrast  is  painful  and  revealing.  The  hacker ideal of 'fix it yourself' collides with a history in which self-reliance was systematically taken away.

An  anonymous  anarcho-syndicalist  Navajo hacker appears as a counter-commentator, by Peter Blok

someone Johannes says he first met at HOPE in 2012. This figure links the ethics of open access and mutual aid with the realities of Indigenous survival. They describe life on the reservation as a constant negotiation with scarcity and control, a  world  where  every  act  of  communication, repair, or connection already counts as hacking. The same instinct that builds community mesh networks also keeps remote families connected to water, food, and history.

Hacking  at  Leaves turns  the  hacker's  gaze back  on  the  hacker  scene  itself.  It  revisits  the familiar genealogy of the Whole Earth Catalog, CCC, L0pht,  and  HOPE,  and  reframes  it  as  a cycle  of  creation  and  capture.  DIY  culture  is celebrated,  but  the  film  keeps  showing  how easily  it  is  domesticated:  how  'makerspaces' become  DARPA incubators,  how  'innovation' becomes extraction with better branding. Uncle Sam keeps demanding a clean, heroic narrative, and the film replies with static and laughter.

It is messy, funny, angry, and packed with  references:  Zizek,  Jello  Biafra,  Navajo hydrologists,  punk  history,  Carl  Sagan,  even RoboCop .  The  editing  feels  like  a  distributed denial  of  service  attack  on  linear  storytelling. Grenzfurthner  does  not  explain;  he  connects, overloads,  and  redirects. Watching  it  at  HOPE was like watching a live packet capture of our own culture - what we were, what we became, and what is left after the hype wave passes.

And then, true to form, he released the entire film for free into the wild on the Internet  Archive. No paywall, no DRM, no licensing restrictions. Just a public upload, an open port. It is a fitting gesture for a movie that treats access itself as a moral act.

For me, the film hits close to home. It is not a  nostalgic  look  back  at  the  'good  old  hacker days.'  It  is  a  confrontation  with  the  question of  what  hacking  means  when  every  exploit eventually gets patched or monetized. Hacking at Leaves does not offer answers, but it gives you the right discomfort.

## Scams and Tricks Dear 2600 :

My local  beer  store  has  a  Bitcoin  ATM  inside.  I dropped in to grab a six and was talking to the manager regarding...  beer.  I  overheard  a  conversation  at  the bitATM and noticed an elderly lady with an older man (her son) trying to talk to someone on the phone while attempting to send money. They were frantic-eyed and obviously (to me) in the middle of a scam.

I  paid  for  my  beer  and  was  told  that  the  clerk couldn't  interfere  over  fears  of  harassment.  Well,  I could, so I approached and tried my very best to get these  people  to  listen  to  me.  I  informed  them  that  I actually lecture seniors on this very thing. I told them exactly what the scam was. I convinced them to call their bank from my phone and check the balance and previous  charges  on  their  account.  I  did  everything except physically intervene or hang up the phone for them.

The scammers convinced these people to leave the store (me) and, I assume, sent them to another location. This poor lady and her son were trying to send them thousands of dollars. I've never been involved in the middle  of  something  like  this  and  felt  powerless.  If it were my family, I would literally have fought them over it.

I deal with people before too much money changes hands - they reach out before the scam gets too far. I  work  with  people  to  restore  their  lives  after  these worms are done. But this is the first time I've run into this exact situation and it freaking sucked. Just wanted to vent to those who might understand.

## Dennis

By  telling  the  story,  it's  possible  someone  might recognize this in the future and either stop themselves or someone else from doing something foolish before it's  too  late.  There  will  always  be  those  who  don't listen, but that's no reason to stop trying. Thanks for sharing.

## DF

Just make sure you get the old addresses and phone numbers right. We imagine a lot of people are trying this little trick.

## Dear 2600 :

I  like  to  mess  with  the  2FA  login  code  phishing scammers  and  keep  sending  them  fake  codes  until they rage quit and get locked out from attempting too many codes. I've even gotten an automated phone call claiming to be Amazon (I very rarely use Amazon), asking me to enter the code that was sent to my phone to  'prevent  fraud.'  I  never  gave  them  the  correct code  and  they  hung  up.  This  happened  twice.  Then they kept trying to rage call my phone because they got  locked  out  from  using  too  many  code  attempts and Amazon flagged the scammers as suspicious. A

## Visionaries

friendly reminder that Amazon, Meta/Facebook/ Instagram/WhatsApp, Signal, etc. representatives will never ask you for these 2FA login codes and will never ask you for your password.

Kyle

What many of these companies will do instead is make it way too hard to shut the scammers down while somehow making it close to impossible to retrieve a stolen account. We've heard many horror stories.

## Dear 2600 :

I'm  a  culture  jammer  and  metalhead  from  the capital  region  of  New  York  and  want  to  know  the easiest  way  to  hijack  the  local  PBS  station  to  do  a parody on the Max Headroom incident to mock a local program director of WPYX in Albany, a classic rock station that doesn't like or is intolerant towards metal.

## Storm

We're not sure this is the best way to get your point across. And why are you picking on the PBS station which has nothing to do with this? Don't they have enough to worry about?

Instead,  why  not  hijack  the  studio  to  transmitter link of WPYX and play some of the metal you wish to share that way? (We actually don't think this is a good idea either, but at least it makes a bit more sense.) And the  Max  Headroom  stunt  was  almost  40  years  ago. Maybe it's time for something else to inspire people?

## Dear 2600 :

Want to make ChatGPT freak out? Just ask it 'is there a seahorse emoji?'

## Peter

People  have  been  having  fun  with  this  one  for  a while. A seahorse emoji has never existed, but many people believe it did. No evidence can ever be found to support that belief. ChatGPT has also (and continues to  this  day)  claimed  it  existed  and  even  produces one when asked. Eventually, it will admit that there is  no  such  thing  and  that  its  false  statement  is  due to  the  Mandela  Effect  (false  memories  by  many  of Nelson  Mandela  dying  in  prison).  ChatGPT  has  a much harder time explaining how it managed to be susceptible to this.

## Following Up Dear 2600 :

I  really  liked  the  article  in  the  summer  issue about  Project  B00KM4RK.  I've  got  some  soldering experience  and  a  decent  knowledge  of  computers, but  I'm  completely  ignorant  when  it  comes  to  using microcontrollers.  This  project  sparked  my  interest philosophically  and  inspired  me  to  use  this  to  try and dip my toes into the microcontroller world. I've assembled the necessary components and put together the hardware as described in the article, but I'm afraid it is at this point my expertise ends.

In the article, it mentions the software infrastructure is freely available, but doesn't go into any more detail about where to find it or how it is implemented.

I've  searched  around  the  web,  but  can't  find  any mention of this project anywhere.

I  was  hoping  you  could  perhaps  put  me  in  touch with the author 'The Slugnooodle' so that they may guide me a little further, or tell me where on the web I could find more information about this project so I may proceed in getting this little gadget up and running.

Ethan

You're not the only one asking. More info below.

Dear 2600 :

I  found  The  Slugnoodle's  article  on  the  Roaming Library a great concept that, based on recent events, may  become  vital  to  the  spread  of  knowledge.  I, however,  could  not  find  any  additional  information on  it.  I  was  wondering  where  I  could  find  more information and how to build my own device.

And, finally, one more.

## Dear 2600 :

I recently sent a letter asking for more information about  the  'Projekt  B00KM4RK'  article  from 2600 42:2. Well, as I'd hoped the author of that project was at  HOPE!  This  project  can  be  found  at  github.com/ TheSlugNoodle/ProjectBookmark, so crisis averted!

HOPE was wonderful. It was the first one I've been to physically and I hope to go back next year.

Rock on, hack on.

Thrilled to hear these connections are being made. It's what magazines and conferences are for.

## Dear 2600 :

On  September  10,  I  began  to  read  the  printed volume  42:2.  Page  8  began  part-way  through  an article. The print challenges must be frustrating. More importantly, the conclusion of the editorial would be nice on a 2600 t-shirt, 'How we deal with people who put forth a different way of looking at things will speak volumes about who we are.'

If there was a problem with your issue, please give us  specifics.  We  will  quickly  replace  it.  Just  email subs@2600.com and, if possible, include a picture of the problem you encountered.

## Dear 2600 :

In regards to JC's letter about potentially malicious USB charging  cables  (42:2),  I  would  mention  that  a standard USB 1.x/2.0 cable typically has four wires: 5V, Ground, Transmit, and Receive. Since the purpose of  a  USB  condom  is  to  prevent  data  flow  while permitting  charging,  it  leaves  the  Tx  and  Rx  wires unconnected. Things are more complicated with USB Type-C, being a 24-pin connector standard. But the philosophy is the same: Only connect pins required for power. If your USB condom was deceitful and turned out  to  be  wired  straight  through,  you  could  find  out with a multimeter or by watching for activity on the USB bus. On the other hand, it is very possible that a decoy condom could integrate a USB 'Rubber Ducky' to deliver malicious keystrokes to the host system. In that case, you would still be able to spot such a thing by watching the USB bus.

## luRaichu

Thanks for that helpful info. Also, it's moments like this when we realize how incomprehensible the things we say can be to those not involved in the world of tech. We need to celebrate that more.

## Dear 2600 :

Thank you for publishing my article 'Let's Hack On' in the Summer 2025 issue (42:2)! I have to make two corrections of my references: Habermas' article on discourse ethics can be found in: Jurgen Habermas, Moralbewusstsein und kommunikatives Handeln . Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp. (1983). Turner's book on  counterculture  and  cyberculture  was  originally published  in  2006,  the  paperback  edition  in  2008.  I enjoyed watching the live streams of this year's HOPE conference. Inspiring talks!

David

Thanks for the feedback and corrections.

## Dear 2600 :

Not sure if this is the correct email address to send this to. The article in this issue titled 'Piracy' (42:2) has a hidden message that reads hello world!

Pretty cool!

Gabe

We're just full of that kind of fun. (But, seriously, tell us where it is.)

## Dear 2600 :

Hi there, I am a repeat offender for many years and decided to switch to PDF/EPUB3 this time. I hope it'll work on my E ink tablet. In the worst case, I'll have to read it as a PDF on my computer or switch back to the printed edition, I guess.

Thanks for the unconditional support. We promise to be there to ensure that it works where you need it to. Differing Views

## Dear 2600 :

I'm  a  61-year-old  hacker  that  started  when  I  first saw an alarm clock and wanted to find out what made it tick. I'm always analyzing setups, looking for stupid security  settings,  and  trying  to  help  technology  get better  through  talent  in  design,  as  opposed  to  just doing  the  minimum  necessary  to  complete  the  job for the bosses knowing we're doing a half-assed job, not  a  hacker's  way  of  thinking,  but  I've  had  clients that  when  I  tell  them  what  should  be  done  to  make a  process  better,  just  wave  me  off  and  tell  me  I'm overdoing  things...  and  this  is  at  the  publicly  held corporation level.

Anyway, I was reading an article in Wired about the executive director  of  the  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation (EFF) talking about their awesome accomplishments, which, to be sure, are many, and also about the big, bad, ugly NSA. She talks about their accomplishments regarding FOSTA-SESTA (look it up, I didn't know what it  was  either)  regarding  laws  to  protect  human trafficking  by  making  publishers  of  sexual  content websites  responsible  for  the  content  of  their  users and advertisers. This law, far from curtailing human trafficking, has left sexual workers who used to freely advertise their wares without a platform for individual endeavors and pushed them into the hands of brokers who now handle their business away from the public eye. Unintended consequences, anyone?

In  another  comment,  she  talks  about  the  NSA

being  bad  people,  intruding  into  people's  privacy, and  spying  on  communications  and  gathering  data from  the  social  network  behavior  of  the  public.  Did I  mention  we  as  hackers  look  for  vulnerabilities  in systems, protocols, and processes? Why do we do it? Other than for, you know, bragging rights? We do it to expose incompetency, lack of care, vulnerabilities, and gross flaws in systems that may have disastrous effects in the life and well-being of others or ourselves, like the relatively easy way any script kid can access your thermostat and compromise your whole network, exposing you to fraud or manipulation. That, and in the old days, to make free phone calls, of course - war spoils.

But the point is the NSA is not doing anything we haven't been doing for the last 50 years. It's just that the hacking is from them to us and not from us to them. They are doing what we do, of course, with unlimited resources,  bless  their  lucky  hearts,  but  it's  the  same thing. The answer is not passing legislation that they will  not  give  a  rat's  butt  about  -  they're  government backed hackers after all. The answer is us educating as many as we can in the ways of protecting their privacy, in  using  free  stuff  like  Instagram  and  Facebook  in a  way  that  does  not  expose  their  whole  private  life to  merchants  and  the  government,  in  instilling  in everyone's mind that if the service is free, you are the product.

We  cannot  get  mad  at  the  NSA.  We  need  to  be smart and throw a monkey's wrench in their machine, like  everyone  messaging  once  a  day death  to  the government or Viva  Bin  Laden or  something  every couple  of  hours  to  increase  the  noise  in  the  signal they're  trying  to  collect.  We're  hackers.  If  we  can't take it, we shouldn't dish it. Educate as many as you can.  Numbers  matter  and  numbers  with  a  common goal matter even more, especially in the situation we find  ourselves  today  with  a  naked  criminal  buffoon with unlimited power and control of all our institutions with no one in a position of power with the nuts to say that the clown has no clothes.

I know, I'm old. But I'm also right, kids. Go help the world even more than you already have. It's you who make a difference. Don't read about it, do it. It feels good. Be good.

## Carlos

There  is a profound  difference  between  what individuals  do  and  what  a  government  agency  with unlimited  resources  can  do.  The  NSA  has  done  so many things that 'we haven't been doing for the last 50  years'  and  it  affects  every  last  one  of  us.  What Edward  Snowden  revealed  so  many  years  ago  was more than enough to be outraged at. There is so much more than that. It's a nice sentiment to say that we're all  basically  the  same  things,  but  that's  really  not what's happening.

To  be  clear,  the  EFF  opposed  FOSTA-SESTA and  argued  that  it  was  unconstitutional  and  would place  an  undue  burden  on  startup  companies  while protecting  the  bigger  ones  and  actually  making  it harder  to  prosecute  human  traffickers.  Only  two senators voted against it.

## Dear 2600 :

The world is becoming less free by the day. Even ostensibly  'democratic'  governments  are  cracking down on free speech, privacy, and security in the name of  'protecting  the  children'  (an  entirely  hollow  and disingenuous claim). Previously, most people's threat models (if they had one) involved malware or phishing attempts by criminal actors in foreign countries, but increasingly our model must include state actors who have physical access to our devices, who will charge us with crimes against the state for posting a political opinion online. There are increasing stories of people being  denied  entry  to  the  United  States  after  CBP agents  confiscated  and  ransacked  their  devices  for subversive political opinions. Soon, American citizens will be detained for similar infractions.

Though  I  am  no  conspiracy  theorist,  even  the staunchest moderate must admit that the similarities between what's happened over the last few years and the  most  outlandish  New  World  Order  conspiracy theories of the 1990s  is stark.  The  explicit  and conscious  goal  of  these  politicians  is  to  consolidate all online media so they control the political narrative and demonize whatever minority group they need to in  order  to  maintain  control.  Today  it's  immigrants, tomorrow it's hackers, and eventually it will be illegal to encrypt anything or have any kind of conversation or gathering without the state as a third party. We will wake up one day and find that we live within our own Great  Firewall,  and  an  entire  generation  will  have grown up without having ever known what freedom of thought tastes like.

## Paul

We  really  want  to  say  that  your  predictions  are overly negative and not entirely based in reality. But we can't. This is, unfortunately, exactly the path we seem to be going down. We always knew this was a possibility and many of us in these pages have been issuing  warnings  about  these  very  scenarios.  Even more of a threat than those people who are pushing for such a society (they were always there and always predictable)  are  the  people  who  simply  don't  care. As long as they are well fed and get their toys to play with,  they  couldn't  care  less  about  vague  concepts like  freedom  and  equality.  When  their  attitude  is diminished, we might actually stand a chance.

## Dear 2600 :

'Banning  TikTok  Was  Wrong;  Ignoring  the  Ban is  Lawlessness'  (42:3)  claimed  that  not  enforcing the  TikTok  ban  is  authoritarian  lawlessness.  It's  a well  established  legal  principle  that  the  executive has  discretion  in  what  crimes  it  prosecutes.  So  it's not  lawless.  But  suppose  it  were,  where  does  that go? Obama had a formal policy of not enforcing the federal  marijuana  ban  in  states  lacking  a  state  ban. Biden  chose  not  to  enforce  much  immigration  law. DACA was  a  formalized  program  to  facilitate  nonenforcement of immigration law. Bush didn't enforce the  Clean  Air  Act  against  coal  plants.  FDR  stopped enforcing  much  of  Prohibition.  Reagan  ignored  the Sherman  Antitrust  Act.  Democratic  sanctuary  cities are  about  non-enforcement  of  federal  immigration

laws. Some Republican localities have the same, but for federal gun control laws. Some state governments and  juries  acted  to  prevent  enforcement  of  the  1850 Fugitive Slave Act, which I suppose the author would call  'authoritarian  lawlessness.'  Trump  is  unique  in many ways, but non-enforcement of laws he doesn't like  isn't  one  of  them.  If  this  is  what  makes  him authoritarian, then we've been an authoritarian nation for  at  least  a  century.  Authoritarianism:  'You  keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.'

## David Libertas

We won't speak for the author. But some of these claims cannot go unremarked. First, you say Trump can't  be  accused  of  not  following  laws  because he's  immune  from  that  as  president.  Then  you  give examples  of other presidents who  you  have no problem accusing of just this. Finally, you say that not only is he immune and not only does everyone do it, but that he is one of the few who doesn't - even though he apparently could if he wanted to without the blame that  everyone else gets. With this kind of a defense, there is really no way he can be accused of anything.

Let's look at some opposing thoughts, often referred to  as  facts.  Trump  has  impounded  congressionally appropriated funds, defied court orders, issued executive  actions  deemed  unconstitutional,  targeted political opponents with prosecution and harassment, ordered  military  strikes  on  boats  in  international waters without providing any evidence against them,  threatened  Democratic  elected  officials  with execution, misappropriated funds, violated the Hatch Act, fired independent watchdogs... and those are just what come to mind without doing any actual digging. They  also  don't  include  the  crimes  he  was  already convicted of, nor do they count his continued ignoring of international law.

The  bitter  irony  is  that  you  may  actually  be able  to  say  that  everything  he's  done  is  completely legal.  When  you  have  a  Supreme  Court  willing  to let  someone  bend  the  law  to  his  heart's  desire  and a congress that is too afraid to stand up to him, the notion  of  legality  begins  to  lose  its  meaning.  But that's  the  beauty  of  the  word  lawlessness.  Even  if everything is done by the book and lawyers, senators, and judges all eagerly agree, lawlessness still defines them if these actions undermine the rule of law and the resulting behavior can be considered outside the spirit of the law. Segregation is one of many examples where  actions  were  considered  legal  but  ultimately were deemed lawless. Many of us may have difficulty wrapping our heads around this today. Rest assured, history will remedy this.

## Dear 2600 :

It  would  be  great  if  your  edge  lord  [redacted]  on the  official 2600 Facebook  group  could  stop  being so  obnoxious  and  banning  so  many  members.  It is  not  good  for  the  community  and  has  lead  us  to form  splinter  groups  that  mainly  despise  him  and completely ruin the hacker spirit and manifesto.

We need a coup d'etat  and  you  need  some  fresh, new 'leadership' in this group.

It's not healthy - get rid of him and his miles-long banned list so everyone can join again.

I believe I'm shouting at clouds and I'm expecting no  result,  as  I  had  no  reply  to  my  previous  emails regarding this issue.

## A Lifetime Subscriber and Always Will Be P

We  appreciate  the  support.  But  let's  once  again make this clear. The Facebook groups run themselves. We pretty much stay out of it. And, for the most part, the groups seem to be a positive thing. But we will not participate in personalities (hence the redaction) or campaigns, coups, or demands. We have three groups so  far  and  there  can  certainly  be  others  if  people don't like how one or more of them are being run. The alternative is for us to get dragged into policing this world which we really have no interest in doing and which would take us away from our many other tasks.

2600 Meeting Fun

## Dear 2600 :

I  attempted  to  go  to  the 2600 meeting  last  week but  wasn't  able  to  find  my  local  hackers.  I  was  at the  meeting  spot  with  a  couple  of  other  people  who decided  to  go  with  me  and  we  were  lost  as  to  who we were supposed to connect with. We tried asking around the restaurant, but everyone seemed confused.

Would  you  be  able  to  help  me  connect  with  the current group?

## Kali

We can't give out contact info other than websites and social media outlets for specific meetings, information that we print each month at www.2600. com/meetings and in the back of our magazine. Just because  you  didn't  see  anyone  and  the  people  you talked  to  were  confused  doesn't  mean  the  meeting isn't  happening.  It's  good  that  you  went  with  others since, technically, you were the meeting that month, assuming you were at the right place. Don't give up - if you keep showing up, we're sure you'll meet other people  who  either  missed  a  meeting  or  two  or  will be coming to their first one like you did. That's how meetings grow.

## Dear 2600 :

I  noticed that there are not any 2600 meetings in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I would be interested in trying to start one or rejuvenate the old one if there was one. I went to a few 2600 meetings in San Antonio, probably 25 years ago, but other than that I'm not very familiar besides having read the magazine a few times. I'm not sure who I know that would be interested in joining 2600 , but I could probably be convinced to sit at a food court every third Saturday of the month or whatever  it  would  be  if  that's  what  it  would  take  to start a new meeting here in Albuquerque. Thanks!

## Stella

Well,  to  start  with,  the  meetings  generally  take place on the first Friday of each month. We do make exceptions,  but  only  if  there  are  a  large  number  of people who can't make the standard day of the month. But making your meeting known will result in people showing  up.  We  can't  say  how  long  that  will  take, but  there's  no  reason  to  think  your  city  will  be  any

different.

## Dear 2600 :

The  new 2600 Orlando  meeting  is  at  2600  E. Colonial Drive at 5 pm. There is a Barnes and Noble right  by  it  you  want  to  pick  up 2600 Magazine .  I'm going to bring my Meshtastic radio device and possibly some other things to play with. There is a rumor that you can bring stuff to swap. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone!

## Edna

With  an  address  like  that,  there  should  have already been a meeting there. This meeting has been added to our list as of last issue. Best of luck.

## Dear 2600 :

I was at work, planning to go to the meeting at 1700 so someone would be there on time. But two people via  our  Signal  group  decided  they  couldn't  wait,  so they  started  at  1500  and  told  people.  I  was  held  up at  work  and  got  there  with  three  colleagues  at  1730 and  we  were  15  people  in  full  discussion,  including some new ones. Two French hackers who just moved to Sweden came. Our meeting place had reordered the sofas and tables a bit, but it didn't matter: This was the first meeting that took up so much space that we just couldn't  fit  as  one  ring;  it  became  two  small  circles next to each other.

People showed Meshtastic stuff. We printed funny hacker meme stickers on my portable sticker printer (from  our  very  popular  'Sticker  Village'  -  www. klisterby.se  -  that  has  become  a  hit  in  Sweden  at conferences this year). Lots of talks about tech.

And  people  mentioned  that  they  are  looking  at venues for a hackerspace. We've gone from not having hackerspaces at all to the first starting last month and two to three more in the works. We have plans for an oldskool  computer  party  next  week,  which  is  a  tech party but with no Internet. Some Germans are gonna come and set up a phone network there.

And a guy showed up who only came once before, like four years ago when I was starting this up and I was alone every meeting for months. And he showed up once, we had a great talk, and then he never came back. I found him at SEC-T last month and said that he should come back ('we're many now - 70 unique visitors the last two years'). So he showed and was just amazed and taken aback that ' Wow , it grew into this ?! I had no idea, I'll come back again.' So that was a very cool win today.

2600 has now become the talk of security people in Stockholm as a 100 percent community event that is  growing  uncontrollably  by  itself,  spawning  other initiatives. Our Signal channel is now 51 people (still only people who have been to a meeting) and they do random meetups and dinners on other days as well. Suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things a hacker can do in Stockholm.

I'm both tired and happy at the same time.

## /Psychad

It's almost frightening the way this meeting continues  to  grow.  But  we  hope  these  updates  also inspire  other  meetings  to  keep  going  and  build  the community. It really can be life-changing.

## Random Info

## Dear 2600 :

A wind phone is an unconnected, physical telephone in a booth that allows people to speak with loved ones who have passed away, serving as a space for grief, connection,  and  emotional  release.  Created  by  Itaru Sasaki in Japan after the 2011 tsunami, the concept has spread  globally,  with  individuals  and  organizations installing  similar  phone  booths  in  public  places  and private spaces to honor lost loved ones and provide a therapeutic outlet for the living. (No dial tone.)

A

We can't imagine why you would expect a dial tone. And we certainly hope they don't take credit cards or quarters.

## Dear 2600 :

I  rented a room near the Pentagon and turned the radio on. It was between channels and, plain as day, I heard Morse code.

## Justin-allen

Without knowing more about the band and frequencies involved, it's impossible to do more than speculate. This could have been anything from ham radio  to  aviation  to  military  use.  Considering  the ease of decoding Morse code, it's doubtful this was anything sensitive. Still, it might be worth it to go back to that neighborhood with a radio cassette player and decode it later.

## Dear 2600 :

I was curious to see if there is still a 'dod.gov' for the  Department  of  Defense  (aka  War).  There  has  to have been a better way for them to handle this. They're not even forwarding the website?

K

The  dod.gov  domain  used  to  forward  to  defense. gov, the official domain of the Department of Defense. However, now the people in charge are calling it the Department  of  War.  So  they  forwarded  defense.gov to war.gov. But they apparently forget about dod.gov which currently goes nowhere. Now, imagine that this is how the actual department is being run, and you're all caught up.

## Dear 2600 :

I've been thinking about The Whistle recently, and a nagging question emerged: Is there any evidence that it was ever actually used as a practical phreaking tool? Yes,  it  produced  the  2600  hertz  tone.  And  yes,  you could use it to force an in-progress long distance call to disconnect. But after that... then what? In order to initiate a new call on that trunk, you'd need a complete set of MF tones (0 through 9 plus KP and ST), which are different from what was available on an ordinary DTMF telephone set of the era. You didn't just blow the whistle and then start dialing a new call right from the telephone itself. A practical blue box will therefore always feature at least 13 keys, often in the form of a standard 12 key dialpad plus a 13th button. Sure, you can generate the MF tones by other means, up to and including a literal piano, but if you have that capability already,  then  you  don't  actually  need  the  whistle  to produce  the  idle  tone.  While  it  may  have  served  as a  point  of  inspiration  for  the  earliest  of  the  phreaks

(arguably Denny Teresi), I cannot recall ever reading an  account  of  the  bo'sun  whistle  ever  being  used  to complete an actual call.

We're not aware of anyone claiming that all you needed was a whistle. The 2600 hertz tone (whistle) was  what  initiated  the  entire  process,  allowing  the user to route their call using MF tones. The tone is a single frequency, whereas the MF (multifrequency) tones  are  a  combination  of  two  (similar  to  DTMF tones  found  on  phones).  So,  while  an  essential  part of a blue boxed call, a 2600 hertz tone needed to be followed by the right MF tones or you wouldn't be able to proceed any further. Conversely, MF tones without the ability to initiate a call would be equally useless.

## Dear 2600 :

On November 22, 1987, an unidentified individual hijacked  the  broadcast  signals  of  two  Chicago-area television stations - WGN-TV Channel 9 and WTTW Channel  11  -  through  an  illegal  intrusion  into  their satellite  feeds,  a  stunt  that  lasted  approximately  30 seconds on each channel and left viewers stunned by its eerie absurdity. Around 9:20 p.m. CST, during WGN's evening  news,  the  feed  cut  to  a  masked  figure  in  a hooded sweatshirt, standing against a black backdrop, who alternated between manic laughter, high-pitched screams, and guttural moans, occasionally lifting his mask to reveal glimpses of a pale, possibly painted face smeared with what appeared to be black streaks. The intruder, dubbed the 'Max Headroom Hacker,' made no demands or statements, only repeating the bizarre performance  -  complete  with  a  distorted,  synthetic voiceover  chanting  'Max  Headroom'  and  flashing text like 'SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME' - before the signal abruptly returned to normal programming. The  second  hijacking  struck  WTTW  minutes  later during Doctor Who , showing the same masked man, this  time  rocking  in  a  chair  while  a  distorted  voice intoned, 'I'd like to be your television,' and a man in a woman's dress spanked him with a flyswatter, ending with the hacker's laughter echoing into static. Federal Communications  Commission  (FCC)  investigators traced the intrusion to a VHF signal override from a nearby Chicago suburb, but despite seizing equipment from  suspects  and  analyzing  the  audio  (revealing  a modified synthesizer), no arrests were made, and the perpetrator's  identity  remains  unknown.  The  event, one of the earliest known TV signal hacks, prompted tighter broadcast security and inspired copycats, but its  motive  -  prank,  protest,  or  pathology  -  stays  a chilling  enigma,  with  the  hacker's  unhinged  moans lingering as a creepy footnote in broadcasting history.

## Johnny

Why it wasn't nominated for an Emmy remains one of the greatest injustices in the history of television. (One correction: it was the microwave signal of each station that was overpowered, not a satellite signal.)

## Dear 2600 :

If  anyone  has  a  Nest  thermostat  that  was  turned into a dumb thermostat from Google dropping support from it, I started this open source project to allow you to  restore  the  functionality  while  removing  Google from  the  device.  You  can  self  host  it  locally  or  use our servers. Feel free to give it a try. Fuck Google nolongerevil.com.

## Cody

This is one of the best projects we've seen recently and  it  underlines  an  increasing  desire  of  people  to be able to control the technology they buy. In short, Google decided to brick working smart thermostats because  they  didn't  want  to  keep  supporting  them. There  is  no  other  way  to  describe  this  as  that  is precisely  what  happened.  Google's  many  defenders claim that technology needs to be updated and that there is no lifetime guarantee for anything. That may be true, but this isn't the same as a device that broke for which there are no longer parts to conduct repairs. These were working remotely controlled thermostats that  were  artificially  broken  by  the  company  that sold  them.  Google  defenders  will  say  that  it  wasn't Google that sold them, but the original Nest company. Again,  this  may  be  true,  but  when  a  company  buys another  company,  they  inherit  the  responsibilities of the company they bought. Apparently, Google felt that offering a newer model at a discount would win people over. It didn't.

Now we have an example of someone taking the technology into their own hands and breathing new life into it. This is precisely how things like this should work. And we need to continue doing precisely that, whether it be for cars, computers, tractors, software, or anything else that is being artificially limited and controlled by companies that want to make even more money off of the people who initially supported them.

Anybody besides me wondering why we don't have an app to vote? Besides the usual reasons, what do you think the pushback would be?

task. The sanctity of the voting booth or private mail disappear when they're replaced by a phone. An app is bound to be compromised at some point if we simply look at the track record of other apps. And who will get blamed when something inevitably goes wrong? The end user? The election board? The app programmers? Or just hackers in general? There would likely be a ton of fingerpointing and no real solution.

There's a reason this hasn't happened. It's because the  failures  are  all  but  guaranteed  and  the  price  of those failures is way too high.

## Dear 2600 :

I'm running Kodi to share my movies/music over my Windows 11 home network. Everything was working fine until I let Micro$hite update this morning. Since then, no file will open. The shares are still working, and I can access all files and folders from the clients on all my TVs, but when I click on any of them, It gives me 'playback failed.' Any suggestions?

## Bill

Our only suggestion is to hold back on the updates until  you  know  what  effect  they  may  have.  It  seems in this case that the codec support changed and your specific  video  format  is  no  longer  supported.  This is  inexcusable  in  our  eyes.  You  should  be  able  to run whatever format you wish and not be subjected to  losing  compatibility  simply  because  some  distant company decides it's time for an update. Yet, this is increasingly  the  type  of  problem  we're  seeing  these days.

Looking online to see if anyone else is experiencing this issue may prove helpful. To confirm if this is in fact the reason, we suggest grabbing one of your files and  transferring  it  to  another  machine  running  a different version of your operating system - or another operating  system  entirely.  If  it  works,  that's  your answer and Microsoft needs to fix what they broke. (Don't hold your breath.)

## Dear 2600 :

The recent hubbub surrounding Windows 10 going out-of-support raises a question for me: What's the big deal? Like, are that many people connecting their PCs directly to the Internet without a hardware firewall in between that this is actually a serious concern? Or are there attack vectors which can plausibly succeed in a hardware firewalled  environment  of  which  I  am  not aware? I try not to be an OS bigot, and I use a variety of systems in my everyday life according to what tool best serves each requirement. But I genuinely do not understand  this  panic  about  ' OMG! WIN10  will  no longer  received  updates '  when  the  Win10  machine I'm writing this from hasn't received a single update since I acquired it roughly five years ago.

## Joe

It really comes down to how careful you are in your daily  operations.  Security  updates  are  important, as  programs you run can be compromised remotely with  tools  that  didn't  exist  when  you  first  started using them. People can open attachments or click on malicious links without being aware of the potential for harm. If you're not in an environment where that's likely to happen, you should be able to keep operating without  incident  -  but  there  is  an  increased  risk. Many people look on the end-of-life panic as a tactic to  get  you  to  constantly  buy  updated  software  (and hardware). And there are people who buy right into that and even allow Microsoft to update and reboot their  machines  without  even  asking  first.  In  fact, it's  getting  increasingly  difficult  to  avoid  this  kind of  behavior.  We  believe  that  in  the  end  it  should  be up to the consumer what version of which operating system they run and how seriously they want to take security updates. However, companies entrusted with our private data must be held to a higher standard, as their bad decisions will affect many others.

## Dear 2600 :

At the end of the article 'After Snow Crash: The Internet  -  An  Alternative  view'  in  42:2,  the  author wrote  'before  the  advent  of  the  Internet  there  was Minitel  in  France,  which  was  a  free  online  service before  it  was  crushed  by  American  cultural  and technological imperialism.' It's not true.

The  Minitel was  an expensive service, billed by the minute, set up before the privatization of the public  operator  France  Telecom.  No  free  access, no Wikipedia or shared knowledge, but rather dubious  pink  messaging  services.  (We  remember the  advertisements  in  the  90s  for  3615  ULLA  fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel\_rose.) The government of  the  time  could  have  given  free  and  open  Internet access  to the French  people,  but  it preferred  to privatize the local loop and subsidize (with citizens' taxes) private companies. However, the first Internet operator in France is an association, FDN, which still provides FTTH and ADSL access today.

For  more  info  about  Minitel  and  free  Internet, you  can  see  Benjamin  Bayart's  conference  -  www. fdn.fr/actions/confs/internet-libre-ou-minitel-2-0/ (in French).

Minitel  ran  from  1982  to  2012  and  started  as  a precursor  to  the  Internet  in  France.  Thanks  for  the clarification on its operations.

## Dear 2600 :

What  advice  would  you  give  to  a  46-year-old middle-aged  man  who  wants  to  learn  more  about Linux, Python, and securing personal devices. I've got the basic knowledge that most people have from using PCs at my workplace, but feel blind overall, like I'm ten years behind.

## Richard

The  most  important  thing  is  to  lose  that  feeling that  you're  hopelessly  behind.  You  will  always  be behind  someone,  but  you  are  way  ahead  of  many

more. Instead of thinking about where you fit in and what you wish you had done instead, simply focus on what it is you're interested in learning about. There are countless tutorials in whatever format you want. There are classes and gatherings where you can pick up even more knowledge. The secret is to be excited and interested in what you're learning. That ensures you'll keep moving forward. At some point, you will have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge, way  more  than  you  thought  you  would  have.  And that's when you can figure out how you want to apply that knowledge. But none of this can happen if you're second guessing your choices and thinking of yourself as less than others. We hope to hear a follow-up down the road.

## Dear 2600 :

With  the  use  of  Pegasus  on  mobile  phones  by governments to spy on journalists, citizens, and anyone they deem a threat, how does one scan for this on their phone? How do you keep it from being installed? And would this application work on a non-smartphone, i.e., flip  phone?  Flip  phone  without  Internet?  Do  phones without Internet still exist?

## James

Pegasus is covert spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group. It was supposedly designed to spy on criminals, but it's predictably being abused by regimes all over the world against their own citizens.  Amnesty  International  has  an  open-source mobile verification toolkit known as MVT which you can access at github.com/mvt-project/mvt. There are also commercial products that can be helpful.

We  don't  believe  Pegasus  can  work  on  a  typical flip phone, as the spyware requires modern operating systems like Android or iOS to run. However, we've heard  of  more  modern  flip  phones  that  can  run Android, so those would be susceptible. And yes, there are  smart  phones  that  don't  have  Internet  service, something that you can always disable or opt out of.

When did the radio show turn into a political hack job? There are so many good political shows. Why not stick with the topic at hand?

## SJ

If  you're  referring  to  'Off  The  Hook,'  it's  most definitely  not  a  political  show.  Current  events  are mentioned when they have an effect on the world of technology,  thereby  becoming  'the  topic  at  hand.'

Ignoring what some refer to as 'politics' would only serve to pretend that what's going on in the real world wasn't actually happening. And when we see human rights abuses, privacy invasions, threats to our environment, and utter incompetence putting us all at risk, that hardly qualifies as politics. Not taking these things  seriously  is  how  we  wound  up  in  this  mess. Maybe we need to focus more on them to keep things from deteriorating even further.

All of that said, we always try and emphasize the relevance  to  the  hacker  and  tech  community  when discussing any of these issues. It just so happens that there are a great deal of topics that are of interest to our listeners.

This con is really awesome, but for next year please do not put it the week right after Defcon.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #16

There are many factors we consider when scheduling. This year it worked out really well, as we were the only group on campus and had a lot more access. Regardless of when we schedule - early, late, July,  August  -  it's  always  going  to  be  inconvenient for some and perfect for others. We hope those who can't be there in person take advantage of our virtual tickets,  which  have  also  been  getting  really  good reviews.

## Dear 2600 :

Thank  you  so  much  for  organizing  HOPE!  I'm a  software  engineer  learning  more  about  security, and  both  the  2024  and  2025  conferences  have  been meaningful experiences for me. I'm grateful for you organizing this all.

My biggest suggestion is to please, in future years, ensure  there  are  vegan  food  options  on  site.  Both years, multiple groups have had to walk to a restaurant 20 minutes away to get food, which means missing out on a lot of the conference.

HOPE\_16 Attendee #17

We have tried for months both this year and last

to  ensure  these  needs  are  met,  only  for  food  trucks and onsite options to come up short. We can't really control  what  is  and  isn't  available  in  the  dining facilities  on  campus,  but  we  will  try  even  harder  to address this. It really shouldn't be an issue, especially since we've been at this a while.

## Dear 2600 :

So the whole locking people on campus is kind of crazy...  but  a  night  shuttle  option  to  bridge  the  gap would be good. Maybe we have to run one ourselves, but I'd be happy to drive folks around!

A shuttle after dark to get people across to the hotel and back from Emerald Pub would kind of be cool, at least until the pub closed.

Also,  with  the  whole  gate  situation,  we  need  an alternative that can take people anywhere on campus and not just have to drop them off at Gate 6.

I  would  assume  they're  not  gonna  change  their locking policy for a few nights of the year just for us, so adapting would be good.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #18

We'll speak to them about this, as the gates weren't supposed  to be locked. As with any  institution, what  one  person  says  doesn't  necessarily  translate to  someone  else  conforming  to  those  guidelines, particularly  when  one  is  in  conference  services  and another  is  in  security.  We  could  use  more  liaisons between the various people we have to interact with. We'll do better on this.

## Dear 2600 :

Today  I  would  just  like  to  say thanks  a  ton for making  my  first HOPE  volunteer experience so positive and welcoming!

I  honestly  did  not  realize  how  much  fun  it  would be and how much I'd enjoy volunteering with A/V. I also made some really great friends and the talks were amazing. I'm also grateful meeting the team.

I  can't  wait  to  get  a  chance  to  volunteer  again.  If there's  any  other  event  between  now  and  next  year where  you  need  volunteers,  please  let  me  know  for sure.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #19

We  hear  this  over  and  over  from  people  who volunteer. Now that we're an annual event, we hope these relationships flourish, which will result in better conferences moving forward.

## Dear 2600 :

This  is  the  second  time  I've  watched  HOPE  live over the Internet. I suggest that the one song played on loop between talks be expanded to a much wider array of musical tracks so as to not annoy the shit out of me after  streaming  three  days  of  otherwise  fascinating presentations. Thank you.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #20

We will be opening that up to additional musicians so you should see some variety.

## Dear 2600 :

Just watching the closing ceremonies and wanted to thank you all so much.

I'm sorry I had to pull out, and I'm sorry I couldn't be  there  in  person.  But  the  virtual  experience  was great, and this HOPE was really good.

Great mix of presenters, with a range from 'this is cool'  through  to  'I  feel  uncomfortable  because  this is  challenging  my  POV.'  Some  hard  questions  and some great discussions, which is what makes HOPE so amazing.

The volunteers and MCs were fantastic. I hope the orange felon gets deposed soon so I can return to the next HOPE.

Thanks again.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #21

The virtual part of HOPE has really taken off and we hope to see it grow even more.

## Dear 2600 :

It  was  great.  Really  great.  Really,  really,  really great. Thank you very much for organizing this! We had a wonderful time.

This  was  my  first  HOPE  at  St.  John's.  I  do  miss the hotel, but it was nice to have so much room and get some exercise and warm up between talks. It was nice  not  to  have  the  hammocks  because  people  who slept there all weekend used to start to smell a little by Sunday morning.

I loved that there was so much about user privacy and free software. I loved all the social justice talks.

The seats are sooo much better than at the hotel.

The emcees were excellent.

All the spaces were good, but the rooms in Tobin were especially great. All that light.

Please take these complaints as suggestions and not as  any  evidence  that  I  didn't  think  this  was  a  great, great conference:

Food options were pretty bad on campus. Especially for vegans. Neighborhood options take a long time if you don't have a car and it also means you miss many precious moments of HOPE! There's a kosher grocery store on the street, and I suppose we could have stocked up on fruit and snacks there (closed 4 pm Friday until 7:30 am Sunday though). We live in New York City, so we could make nice food at home and bring it, but the folks from out of town aren't so lucky.

Please  reach  out  to  me  when  you  have  recovered from HOPE\_16 and I will try to help find food vendors for  HOPE  26.  If  you  already  have  information  on things like rules for food trucks and what the school will allow to be sold, if anything, please send me that if you think I can help.

www.veggiekarte.de is a site that looks for vegan/ vegetarian friendly restaurants on openstreetmap. We should ask folks to work more on this. Not a lot on the map around St. John's right now. Maybe there is more. I can help with this too.

Um,  no  Club-Mate  for  sale?  I  drank  the  school's coffee instead. One gets used to it.

The podium in Marillac blocked the screen.

I  am  old,  and  my  hearing  isn't  great,  but  I  still think the sound in Marillac was terrible. I don't know where the speakers were. Behind the podium? In the projectors? It was very hard to hear if you sat under the balcony or whatever the overhang is in the back. And sitting in front was not much better.

In  general,  presenters,  especially  if  they  are  new

to public speaking, need to be told to slow down and open their  mouths  when  they  speak.  The  guys  from MIT  who  made  the  medical  drones  in  Mexico,  for example. Wonderful people, great project, difficult to understand. Well, I thought so anyway.

One of the folks who worked on the sound/video boards has a wonderful resonant bass voice and this means he can be heard all over the room even when he talks quietly. During talks, folks at the board need to  whisper.  I  mean,  right?  I  know  he  often  has  to train a volunteer to work the board, but I hope he can find some way to do it so he doesn't distract from the presentation.

Could  you  encourage  the  not-so-tech  folks  to  go into some practical detail? I think we at HOPE all like a bit of detail. Don't we? For example, in the talk 'New Journalism: Reimagining Information Networks From the Ground Up' (which was excellent! ), the fellow said that  there  were  examples  of  community  information networks that resembled how he would like journalism to be, and he named about six, but he never went into the details of how these groups worked. Apparently, Chinese immigrants trying to cross a river in, I think, Colombia,  all  communicate  about  how  to  cross  and where the best places are to do it. But how? Is that on text? Do they have websites? By word of mouth? Chalk on the trees? Etc.

You need more volunteers. That's my fault.

Thank you again for a great conference! Congratulations!  So  glad  there  is  still  HOPE  in  the world!

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #22

These  are  all  great  critiques  and  suggestions. We definitely need to do better with food options, as mentioned previously. We tried to get people to sell Club-Mate and keep all the money for themselves, but we couldn't find a hackerspace or company willing to commit to this. We'll keep trying. We will also forward the A/V issues to people who can do something about them.  As  for  specific  talks,  nearly  all  of  them  have contact info which we suggest you pursue to ask them questions or make suggestions. If they're not already up on our YouTube channel (Channel2600), they will be soon.

We're glad you had fun and look forward to seeing you at the next one!

## Dear 2600 :

It  was  my  first  HOPE  convention  and  I'd  love  to come back next  year.  I  suggest  holding  the  event  at LaGuardia Community College next year because it is a big venue, it's centrally located, there are plenty of places to go after the con, and it has all the facilities you'd need to run a con.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #23

We're quite happy where we are, at least for now. But  we  appreciate  people  looking  into  alternatives as  it's  always  good  to  be  prepared  for  change.  We learned that once.

## Dear 2600 :

I really enjoyed this year's conference and wanted to thank you all for your hard work and dedication!

I hope to make it in person and volunteer!

## Cheers, and let me know how I can assist in any

way!

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #24

You can help out in person or online. It's essential for volunteers to get involved well before the conference  actually  happens.  This  allows  us  to  do things  like  start  new  projects,  update  the  website, reach  out  to  more  potential  attendees,  get  press attention,  etc.  Our  biggest  problem  continues  to  be difficulty  in  getting  the  word  out.  We  don't  have  the means to hire a big publicity firm to do this for us. Ironically, if we did, we probably wouldn't need them.

## Dear 2600 :

Thank you all again for putting on another amazing year of HOPE! Thank you for giving me a speaking opportunity and for making my seventh time at HOPE a memorable one!

I'd  like  to  give  a  little  feedback  on  one  issue  that I'm sure a few attendees may agree on: while St. John's University is a good venue and plenty spacious, there is one issue with them that I have, and that's namely the closing of all the gates on campus before midnight.

On Saturday, 16 August, a number of attendees of HOPE attempted to leave the campus via Gates 4 and 5, which exit to Union Turnpike and are also the closest gates to the main three buildings HOPE uses (Little Theatre, Marillac Hall, Tobin School). However, it was near midnight and both gates were found to be locked. We were told by campus security to exit via Gate 6, but Gate 6 is on the other side of the campus, and is a very long walk from HOPE's location. Additionally, several of the attendees have disabilities and can't walk long distances like that, combined with the fact that most of us didn't come in via car and used either mass transit (which  is  available  along  Union  Turnpike)  or  a  cab service. We finally had to call public safety to make them unlock Gate 4 to let us out.

For future HOPEs, can we please communicate with the university that, while HOPE is running or events are going on, that Gate 4 please remain unlocked and open until all attendees not staying on campus exit the grounds, and that they be open in the mornings early to allow easy access to the buildings from the Union Turnpike side. This'll make it far easier for attendees who take bus lines like the Q45 or come in via Uber/ Lyft/cab to get out and be close to the HOPE buildings.

Thank you for keeping the hacker spirit alive, and let's all help one another out by making things easier.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #25

You're absolutely right to insist on this and there really  isn't  an  excuse,  particularly  when  this  very point  was  brought  up  to  our  hosts  when  we  had  a similar  problem  during  HOPE  XV  in  2024.  We  will make sure it's an urgent issue that needs to be taken seriously and we apologize for the inconvenience.

## Dear 2600 :

Thank  you  so  much  for  another  amazing  HOPE! As  a  remote  attendee,  it  definitely  felt  smaller  than previous years, but that might just be because I'd just attended  WHY  [the  Dutch  hacker  camp]  remotely, which felt huge

I  particularly  wanted  to  thank  moderators  for

doing such an amazing job on Matrix of taking our questions;  that  definitely  went  a  long  way  towards feeling included.

- I saw fewer updates from the villages than previously. Obviously, not something you can directly control, but I wonder if there could be an easier way for  in-person  people  to  share  news  to  Matrix.  Or maybe  encourage  people  to  post  to  Fediverse  more, and have a designated hashtag that gets mentioned at the start of each talk.

I think given the state of the U.S. border, it's likely we'll see lower in-person attendance again next time. One thing I've always wanted to see done is a European location showing the livestreams for us Europeans to attend. It sounds like a lot of work though, and I don't know how well attended it would be.

Finally,  if  there's  any  further  emails  going  out,  it would be nice to encourage people to join the Matrix if they haven't already done so. That way we can keep the  community  going  remotely  until  the  next  time. And I think a lot could be done with that.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #26

Thanks for the feedback. While we know attendance from other countries has been adversely affected for everyone, this shouldn't affect virtual attendance and participation. If anything, we should see an increase to make up for not being able to be there in person. And,  if  foreign  travelers  aren't  able  to  make  it,  we don't see why domestic travelers should be affected, other than the usual hell of flying. For those virtual attendees who used Matrix, we hope these discussions are ongoing.

## Dear 2600 :

Long time 2600 reader, but this was my first HOPE conference  and  it  was  amazing.  This  was  not  just  a conference  I  felt  welcomed  at,  but  also  welcomed to  become  a  part  of,  since  you  made  it  so  easy  to volunteer. All of the staff I engaged with were great and the conference felt well run. I was volunteering for security when a potential security issue arose. The whole thing was handled well by both the HOPE staff and the school security.

Thanks  again  and  looking  forward  to  the  next HOPE.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #27

We are so proud of our security team and Operation Hammond who interfaced really well with St. John's security team, who also were top notch. Together, they were able to deal with various problems that came up and keep them from becoming issues that attendees would notice. They all deserve our thanks.

## Dear 2600 :

This  was  my  first  ever  in-person  conference  and my  first  HOPE.  I  saw  that  you  all  really  wanted feedback, so I wanted to send you a mini-novella with my thoughts. I didn't take the time to read conference materials  before  arriving  on  campus,  so  please  take everything I say with a grain of salt!

Things that went great:

-  The  people  there  were  amazing,  especially  the staff/volunteers.  The  conference  volunteers  are  what
- make  me  want  to  return  again  during  the  next  inperson con.
- Especially loved Jason Scott's presentation style. I was dog-tired during the talent show, but his ability to MC really kept my attention going. Love his sense of humor. Every time he was on the mic, I was hooked.
-  Mitch  Altman's  personal  presentation  at  the end  of  the  first  night  made  me  tear  up  (in  a  good way). I'm almost 40 and I'm such a softy, but I never thought I'd be getting such feelings during this type of conference. I especially appreciate how he did this great  presentation,  all  while  pretty  sleep-deprived from his travels.
- Great help desk placement.
- Having on campus housing was very convenient.
- Having all of the conference sessions/workshops being  within  close  walking  distance  of  each  other was great. Walking between buildings helped with a change of scenery.
- Lots of cool stickers.
-  The  presenter  selection  was  great.  Joseph  Cox and other recognizable names made it quite the treat to attend.
- The vendors were pretty cool. Very friendly, and were great at talking about what they do.

Potential areas of improvement:

-  Matrix account creation: I didn't sign up before the  conference,  and  I  didn't  bring  a  laptop.  I  found that  the  recommended  app  on  the  wiki  had  issues with conference chat access over the phone on Android (shared spaces wouldn't show up on mobile). I  ended  up  using  FluffyChat  starting  on  Day  2  and had no issues. Suggestion: update the wiki to ensure new  mobile-only  accounts  can  sign  up  and  access conference chats. A video guide or more screenshots could be useful, but not necessary.
-  Conference  digital  communication:  Based  on Matrix being relatively quiet for a lot of the conference, I'm betting a lot of attendees didn't access it at all. Not sure if that was by design or if we wanted the numbers to get pumped up online.
-  Campus  maps:  couldn't  find  the  one  with  the arrows/building locations on it at first. Took me a bit to pull it up. I didn't realize the wiki was a thing until after I got to the conference.
- Workshops' cost transparency in advance. Likely because I'm very new to tech cons, I didn't know the workshops had costs associated  with  them.  Obvious in hindsight (materials aren't free), but if the schedule had  the  costs  tagged  onto  them,  it  would  have  been easier  for  me  to  financially  map  out  my  conference time.  Having  cost  links  on  the  workshop  sections, where possible, might have been helpful for plotting out my day. I saw that some of the workshop rooms had  this  listed  on  the  calendar  schedule  attached  to the  windows.  Being  able  to  see  if  from  the  digital schedule/website would have been helpful.
-  Social  media:  wish  there  was  more  of  it.  I  had Mastodon notify me of whenever the official account made a post. Liked the posts made, but would have loved to see more.

- Walking guide-type videos of the conference could have been cool. Would have loved to see 'hype reels'/ photos of workshops and other parts of the conference throughout  the  day  (or  on  the  next  day).  Definitely would have made me upset about all the cool stuff I missed (in a good way). Imagining zoomed in shots of the soldering workshops, conference halls with people chatting  (photos  posted  with  their  consent),  people at  the  info  desk  waving,  local  eats,  etc.,  etc.  I  guess having  volunteer  photographers  would  be  needed  to make this happen.
-  Housing issues (more SJU feedback than HOPE feedback). My room wasn't cleaned before I arrived, I didn't have a mattress until after 10, and I didn't have a  pillow  until  Day  2.  The  SJU  conference  staff  was awesome about resolving these issues. Not sure what could be done to fix this on the HOPE end, but back when I ran summer conference housing at a college I worked at, some camps had skeleton keys that they would  use  to  check  on  their  campers'  suites  before they  arrived,  or  to  help  them  with  lockouts.  This approach  for  a  hacker  conference  might  cause  more problems than it resolves though! I let SJU know my feedback. No issues with them at all.
-  I  was  a  late  registrant  for  housing  and  the  first one  in  the  suite.  Since  it's  a  hectic  time  of  year  for colleges (student check-in around the corner), having HOPE slightly earlier (like mentioned in the closing ceremony) might help resolve some of these issues.

If I could do it all over again, I would:

- Socialize more.
- Go to more workshops and less talks.
- Not walk as much in the heat (showers can only do so much - I kept giving myself sniff tests, but you never know if you're just immune to your own brand sometimes, you know?).
- Bring a friend.
-  Read  over  more  conference  materials  before attending (set up Matrix, etc.).

Looking  forward  to  next  year,  and  potentially volunteering  this  time!  Big  appreciation  for  all  that you and the crew do.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #28

Pretty much all of the issues cited here can be fixed with  more  volunteers.  We  can't  really  address  the things that we don't run ourselves (such as Matrix and the dormitories), but we can certainly chime in with suggestions. As for workshop costs, we post that info at  wiki.hope.net.  We  don't  list  specific  prices  in  the printed program, as we don't want paid attendees to feel that there's an additional cost to walk in the room. Any  conference  attendee  is  welcome  to  attend  any workshop without cost to observe or if they already have the required materials.

## Dear 2600 :

I  attended  a great New  York  City  event  on  the subject  that  I  admire/enjoy/love  to  read/listen/dream about.

I love the networking with vendors and attendees, the  workshop  on  'Pirating:  the  Past,  Present  and Future,' my failed three attempts to get a general FCC

ham radio license and just walking around and living my life.

My  only  issue  was  the  food  service,  nothing  to write  home  about,  a  plain  jane  experience.  For  the future,  a  wish  to  see  a  ten-plus  food  truck  vendor van stampede. This would be like the Meadowlands Racetrack summer events extravaganza with 20-plus food trucks to get your gorge on event.

In  all,  a  great  event,  experience,  and  feeling  of anxiety for the next one. Let's go!

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #29

It's remarkably difficult to get food trucks to show up  to  an  event,  even  when  we  offer  to  not  take  a percentage of  their  earnings  or  charge  a  fee  of  any sort. We will keep trying.

## Dear 2600 :

I really enjoyed HOPE and visiting New York City. To be clear, I'm only mentioning these mostly minor complaints because an organizer asked me to. I know it can be difficult to get constructive criticism, so I am sending this in.

- The food court near the sponsor tables was bad. They  actually  ran  out  of  coffee  for  a  little  while.  I ended up walking to a bodega in the morning and then skipping lunch to have a nicer dinner.
-  I'd  prefer  to  just  use  Slack  or  Discord  since  I already  have  an  account  there  versus  the  Matrix/ Element app.
-  The  schedule web view is kind of awkward. I'd rather  have  a  PDF  or  a  simple  table  than  something trying to be too fancy. I'm forwarding an example of something I wrote for another conference a couple of years ago. Feel free to steal it.

Thanks again for the nice conference.

## HOPE\_16 Attendee #30

We  really  like  your  design  and  will  consider adopting this instead of what we've been using. There are  lots  of  considerations  and  perspectives,  but  we promise to look into improving the overall look.

It's  clear  from  all  of  the  feedback  (and  we'll stop  here)  where  we  need  to  make  improvements  or different decisions. This is all super helpful. Let's see if it results in even better feedback a year from now.

## EFFecting Digital Freedom

by Thorin Klosowski

## When AI and Secure Chat Meet, Users Deserve Strong Controls Over How They Interact

Both  Google  and  Apple  keep  cramming new  AI  features  into  their  phones  and  other devices, and neither company offers clear ways to  control  which  apps  those  AI  systems  can and  cannot  access.  AI  features  can  create  a variety of potential privacy problems, but one of  the  most  important  aspects  to  get  right  is how those tools interact with secure messaging apps, like Signal or WhatsApp. There's confusion around how 'device-level' AI tools like  Apple  Intelligence  and  Google  Gemini handle information, whether it's kept local or sent to a server, and what that information gets used for. This makes it far more difficult to lock down your privacy than it should be.

The  current  issues  with  secure  messaging relate to two primary privacy problems: composing messages using AI tools, and having a  receiver's  copy of messages potentially end up in AI tools automatically without the sender realizing it.

Let's  start  with  sending  messages.  As  an example,  Google  Gemini  lets  you  optionally link Gemini  and WhatsApp,  so you can compose a message in Gemini and then send that  through  WhatsApp. In this case, Google can  usually  see  the  content  of  the  created message. Depending on your settings, Google may  use  the  contents  of  that  message  for continued AI training and it may be saved to your account, making it potentially accessible to law enforcement if requested.

Apple  doesn't  offer  a  similar  WhatsApp integration  feature,  but  its  'Writing  Tools' pop-up offers some of the same functionality, though  it  doesn't  appear  inside  WhatsApp (or  Signal,  for  that  matter).  Any  text  created using  the  Apple  Intelligence  writing  tool  in Apple Messages could go to Apple's 'Private Compute' cloud servers, where hardware protections limit Apple from easily accessing this data. (Google recently announced a similar 'private compute' cloud in the fall of this year, but which features will use it isn't clear yet.)

When receiving messages, things get trickier.  When  you  use  an  AI  like  Gemini or  Apple  Intelligence  to  summarize  or  read notifications,  it's  not  always  clear  where  the text  of  those  notifications  goes,  how  long  it might be stored for, or if the company has the technical means to read it. Poor documentation and  weak  guardrails  often  fail  to  clarify  the privacy  practices  as  clearly  as  we'd  like.  In Google's case, we found that if a user opts into a series of different features, including granting Gemini  access  to  notifications  through  the

Utilities app, then that data is sent to Google and  appears  to  be  readable  by  the  company regardless  of  whether  the  recipient  sees  the messages. Since this choice is out of the hands of  the  sender  of  that  message,  it  creates  the potential for a privacy issue. In contrast, Apple claims its summarize feature happens entirely on-device.

## New AI Features Must Come With Strong User Controls

As more  device-makers cram more  AI features into their devices, the more necessary it  is  for  us  to  have  clear  and  simple  controls over  what  personal  data  these  features  can access  on  our  devices.  If  users  do  not  have control  over  when  text  leaves  a  device  for any sort  of  AI  processing  -  whether  that's  to a 'private' cloud or not - it erodes our privacy and  potentially  threatens  the  foundations  of end-to-end  encrypted  communications.  Some solutions we would like to see:

-  Per-app  AI  Permissions: Google,  Apple, and  other  device  makers  should  add  an operating  system-enforced  AI  permission, just like they do for other potentially invasive privacy  features,  like  location  sharing,  to their phones. You should be able to tell the operating system's AI to not access an app, even if that comes at the 'cost' of missing out on some features.
- Offer On-Device-Only Modes: Devicemakers  should  offer  an  'on-device  only' AI mode for those interested in using some features without having to try to figure out what happens on device and on the cloud.
-  Improve Documentation: Both Google and Apple should improve their documentation about how these features interact with various apps. Apple doesn't seem to clarify notification  processing  privacy  anywhere outside  of  a  press  release,  and  we  couldn't find anything about Google's Utilities privacy at all.

The  current  user  options  are  not  enough. It's clear  that  the  AI  features  come  with significant confusion about their privacy implications,  and  it's  time  to  push  back  and demand better controls. The privacy problems introduced  alongside  new  AI  features  should be  taken  seriously,  and  remedies  should  be offered  to  both  users  and  developers  who want  real,  transparent  safeguards  over  how a  company  accesses  their  private  data  and communications.

## Why Can' t We Have Nice Things?

by Barry Rueger

Every day, and in every way, it feels like life has become  an  endless  battle  against  bad  software. No,  not  my  trusty  Linux  Mint  laptop,  or  even (mostly)  LibreOffice,  but  just  about  everything else,  and  especially  any  phone  app.  So,  dear programmers, here are my requests.

Your  software  has  to  work  all  of  the  time. Period. I've lost all patience with programs that work some of the time, but then crap out the next day.  Yes, bugs crop up, no matter how hard we try, but with phone apps especially it too often feels as if something half-finished was shoved out the door.

Your interface should never, ever change. One reason  for  abandoning  Microsoft  was  because things  that  seemed  fine  suddenly  get  updated and  work  differently.  Things  I  use  daily  would disappear into obscure sub-menus, or just cease to exist. Remember, 90 percent of computer use is  based  on  muscle  memory  and  unconscious actions.  Your fingers automatically do what your brain wants. In other words, CTRL-X and CTRL-V should never, ever, change.

Bluetooth sucks 10 percent of the time. Either because  it  takes  too  many  steps  to  connect,  or because  it's  Thursday  and  has  just  concluded that  it  doesn't  want  to  work. And  especially  in cars, which surely is the only place with software worse than phone apps. Speaking of which...

I  do  not  need  another  parking  app  on  my phone. Seven of them is enough, and only two of them work reliably. There's utterly no reason why you would write yet another parking app.

I  do  not  want  to  update  your  software  right now - either I'm in the middle of actual work, or I sense that almost certainly the update will break something I need. For years now, I put off doing any update until I know I have time to fix what it breaks.

If your phone app demands a six number code for  two  factor  authentication, have  the  good manners to change the keyboard to a number pad.

If  your  phone  app  expects  an  email  address, have  the  good  manners  to  give  me  a  keyboard layout that includes an @ sign.

I really, really do not need another parking app on my phone. Seriously.

No, I do not want notifications. Ask me once, then bugger off.

No, I do not want your app or program to beep at me. Ask me once, then bugger off.

No  I  do  not  want  your  app  or  program  to suddenly switch to 'night mode. '

No,  I  neither  need  nor  want  any  of  your 'Themes.'

No, I do not want my data stored on your cloud, no matter where it is. Ask me once, then bugger off.  This  is  especially  true  because  sometimes there's actually no Wi-Fi, or even no 5G signal. If your app or program can't work without those, I don't want them.

No, I do not want your AI suggestions. Or your horrible and useless AI chat bot.

Advertising. I  prefer  open  source,  but  will actually pay for software if it works well. (When I say 'pay,' I mean 'buy,' not 'subscribe.') I will also immediately remove any program that serves up more advertising than actual useful functions. On my computer, or on my phone, unsolicited ads will turn me off immediately.

Are  the  conventions  that  we  use  in  software perfect? Probably not. Should you change them  just  because  you  have  a  better  idea?  Not if  you  want me to use it. Everyone at 2600 has surely heard the story about how the QWERTY keyboard was designed to slow down typists, and how DVORAK is better, but the truth is that 99 percent of people are happy with QWERTY, and it would bug the heck out of them if you changed it.

In  all  of  the  above  list,  there's  one  common thread: software companies have abandoned offering  support  to  customers.  More  often  than not,  their  website  has  no  phone  number  and  no email  address.  Maybe  a  web  form,  but  more likely a brain dead chat bot. Trust me, by the time I've reached any of those, I've already tried every fix I can think of, and most of what I can find on Reddit or forums. If I can't actually contact you with a question, your software disappears.

And did I mention, I really, really do not need another parking app on my phone.

## Why Data Privacy Is the Battle of Our Time

Most people don't walk around thinking about packet headers, ISP metadata, or how many times their phone pings nearby towers. And why would they? The systems we rely on - search engines, smartphones, social media - are designed to just work .  But  that  ease  comes  at  a  cost  most  never see.

This article is here to peel back the layers and show how the very technologies that connect and empower  us  can  also  become  tools  of  control, surveillance, and erasure. And more importantly, it's here to show what we can do about it.

## The Current Digital Hellscape (with a smile)

By mid-2025, America's data privacy framework looks like a vintage router with half its ports fried and no firmware updates since 1998. Corporations  hoard  user  data  like  gold  bullion. Governments  tap  that  same  data  pipeline  under the  banner  of  'safety.' Your  clicks,  your  chats, your location at 2:34 AM last Tuesday - they're all in the feed.

Meanwhile,  our  digital  infrastructure  shows its  vulnerability.  Take  the  massive  2025  dataset purges from federal websites -over 8,000 scientific and environmental pages vanished overnight, and approximately 3,000 datasets were removed  from  federal  websites,  creating  gaps in  crucial  scientific,  health,  and  environmental information. Or the attack on the Internet Archive in  late  2024,  which  temporarily  erased  swaths of  our  digital  memory,  creating  what  archivists call a 'black  hole'  in our collective digital history. We're losing knowledge in the name of compliance and control.

Corporations continue to vacuum up personal data - location history, search patterns, biometrics -  and use it for behavioral profiling and algorithmic manipulation.  The  legal  framework  meant  to protect  users  is  inconsistent  at  best.  States  are passing  a  patchwork  of  privacy  laws  that  mean nothing when the average American doesn't even know how to enable app permissions. And don't get  me  started  on  the  commercial  DNA  trade  where your genetic blueprint can be repackaged and sold before your results even hit your inbox.

While  a  few  states  have  passed  their  own privacy laws, there's still no unified federal policy in place, and in the meantime, most people don't  know what data is being collected, who's collecting it, or what it's being used for.

Polls show that 81 percent of Americans worry about  corporate  surveillance,  and  71  percent about government overreach, but over 60 percent say they feel powerless to do anything about it. We are not powerless.

## Why Data Privacy Is the Battle

Why  is  data  privacy  more  than  just  a  tech issue? Because without privacy, every other freedom collapses in silence.

Freedom of speech means nothing if your DMs get flagged and your location is logged every time you step into a protest. Freedom of the press falls apart  when  whistleblowers  can't  communicate without  being  traced,  indexed,  and  unmasked. Even the right to assembly becomes performance art if the government watches from above, crossreferencing  your  face  with  a  license  plate  and your recent search history.

What  we're  losing  isn't  just  convenience  or anonymity - it's agency. It's the ability to learn, connect, dissent, and grow without being scored, sorted, or sold.

Think about it:

Reproductive  rights are  undermined  when apps track menstrual cycles, and location data is subpoenaed to prosecute 'wrong' choices.

Voting rights are twisted when AI systems target disenfranchised groups with misinformation  campaigns,  tailored  by  data  we gave away for free.

Economic justice breaks down when algorithms gate access to loans, housing, or jobs based on data profiles that you can't see, edit, or escape.

The infrastructure of surveillance is becoming the operating system of daily life. And the deeper it embeds, the harder it gets to resist - until what we once called freedom becomes a UX illusion wrapped in push notifications.

This is why data privacy is the battle. It's not just about tech. It's about power - who has it, how it's used, and whether you ever get it back.

## The Resistance: Veilid, EFF, and the New Digital Underground

There are groups fighting back - technologists, lawyers,  activists  -  each  building  pieces  of  an Internet that puts people, not profits or power, at the center.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has been  on  the  frontlines  for  decades,  defending encryption,  privacy,  and  digital  civil  liberties. They're pushing back against invasive legislation like New York's age-verification bill, which could create  a  de  facto  national  ID  system.  They're challenging  unconstitutional  surveillance  in  the courts.  And  they're  standing  up  for  end-to-end encryption when lawmakers try to dismantle it in the name of 'safety.'

Then there's Veilid - a newer force with oldschool  hacker  DNA.  Lead  by Veilid  foundation

members Dildog, Medus4, and TheGibson, Veilid is a decentralized, encrypted, peer-to-peer network protocol designed to make surveillance obsolete by design. It's an infrastructure project. An Internet without servers. A platform without profiling. A privacy layer that doesn't ask for your permission. If  the  clear  web  is  a  mall, Veilid  is the  underground  rave  happening  in  the  subway tunnels  beneath  it  -  raw,  resilient,  and  built  by the  people  who get  it .  'With Veilid,  the  user  is in  control,  in  a  way  that  is  approachable  and friendly, regardless of technical ability. We want to give the world the Internet we should have had all along.' veilid.com/why-use-veilid/

## Building Resistance: Projekt B00KM4RK and PRJKT DJ

The events of the past few years lit a fire under me.  First  came  Projekt  B00KM4RK  -  a  dirtcheap,  decentralized  roaming  library  built  on  a NodeMCU ESP8266. You connect to its Wi-Fi, you  get  the  goods:  banned  books,  lost  articles, endangered  research.  No  Internet  needed.  No login.  No  trail.  Just  knowledge  served  up  neon green on black like it's 1995 and we're hacking the Gibson.

Now, I'm working with MegabyteGhost on  PRJKT  DJ,  a  music-focused  companion  to Projekt B00KM4RK. It's still under construction, but the mission is clear: to create a decentralized, self-hosted music library where people can upload and access songs listed by artist, album, or title - free from algorithms, ads, and licensing shackles. PRJKT DJ is about archiving culture in motion. It's about making music resilient.

These tools aren't just projects. They're compute-grenades: weapons in the fight for digital freedom - and blueprints for what comes next.

## How You Can Join the Fight

You don't need a CS degree or a darknet invite to  make  a  difference.  The  privacy  movement thrives on participation, technical and otherwise. Here's how to plug in:

Support  the  fighters. Groups  like  the  EFF, ACLU, and the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project need donations, signal boosts, and volunteers. Even sharing their alerts on social media expands the resistance.

Use and build privacy-respecting tools. Switch  to  alternative  browsers.  Ditch  Chrome and Edge. Use Signal. Learn about self-hosting. Fork  open-source  tools  and  make  them  more accessible. Set up a Veilid node and experiment with decentralized alternatives.

Educate  your  community. Host  workshops. Print zines. Teach your friends how to check app permissions or use burner devices. Hackers don't just code - they share knowledge.

Subvert  the  algorithm. Host  a  mirror  of  a banned book collection. Seed torrents of public domain datasets. Archive what matters before it disappears. Censorship works best in silence - so make noise.

Get  hands-on. Create your own  projects. Identify a need. Gather a community. And build a solution.

This  is  the  moment.  Either  we  rebuild  the Internet from the ground up, or we spend the next decade watching it weaponized against us - our history, our culture, our selves. If you're reading this,  you're  already  part  of  the  resistance.  Now it's time to act like it.

Stay dangerous.

## Ungovernable

by thetechnocore

Uncontrollable.  I  stumbled  upon  this  idea while  laying  in  bed  one  late  Sunday  evening, pondering  why  I  am  the  way  I  am,  and  more importantly, why I do the things that I do. Or, as we shall see, fail to do.

time,  with  the  continued  application  of  nacre (mother-of-pearl).  However,  to  the  normal  or orthogonal observer, humans, pearls have value, or are assigned value.

Oftentimes we are taught to take the normal view (I am using normal here in the mathematical sense), the view that juts out of the current plane of  thought  or  consciousness.  In  so  doing,  if  I am unable to control my tendencies, how may I benefit from them. How does the oyster benefit from  the  pearl?  If  we  are  to  remain  in  typical planar thought, we may be hard pressed to find a benefit to the oyster that the pearl bestows. To the  oyster,  the  pearl  is  already  the  result  of  an ungovernable situation. A situation outside of the oyster's control, and thus the irritating speck of debris is made more and more manageable, over

I have for some time now been over-employed. I  am  a  remote  worker  working  more  than  a single full time job. I am fortunate in that I have been able to  find  roles  that  are  complementary or  in  the  same  field.  Being  introverted  and perhaps overcompensating for my prior lack of employment,  I  find  the  current  situation  quite amenable. I have over time devised methods to address the situations where my attention needs to be divided at the current moment - think two meetings at the same time - and how to maximize my efficiency in completing the tasks assigned to me. From strategizing lunch, appointments, and even environmental events, I have been able to do

quite well in my current roles. I tend to shoot for the middle - an entire article can be dedicated to the acts of self-sabotage to ensure you are viewed as a line worker and not a shift lead (leadership positions tend to have more meetings and are far less reactive). I don't have any designs to lead the service desk - just be a member of it and work my tickets, nothing more, nothing less.

I  have  also,  for  the  majority  of  my  life,  at least  as  long  as  my  memory  serves,  had  issues with authority or doing tasks I find them menial and/or  boring.  IT  in  many  respects  is  the  safe haven  for  people  like  myself;  we  find  solace in  the  computers,  their  binary  nature  easy  to comprehend. It is the people that I find tedious. Software updates, log queries, helping Steve with the same issue every month; facile and oftentimes I  am eager to help. Except printers... god damn every single printer. It is, however, inevitable that I will find myself tasked with a job I am loathe to do. Sometimes I am able to outmaneuver the ask, however,  more  often  than  not,  I  must  comply. Therein  lies  the  dilemma.  Oftentimes,  the  ask is  simple,  and  if  I  would  complete  the  task  set before  me,  I  would  be  better  for  it  in  almost every  respect.  For  whatever  reason,  and  I  have thought on this for years, I am unable/unwilling to comply. Depending on the role and task, the seeds of ruin may have been sown. To that oyster of a manager, I am the speck of debris ruining their  otherwise  productive  life.  But...  if  I  can learn as much as possible from the role and even better how to deal with oysters, then I can be a pearl to the next manager.

## Analysis

Normally this line of thought would be wildly unproductive.  However,  I  am  playing  the  long game, and in parallel. I have often stated that one if not the greatest - benefit of over-employment is the rate at which, relative to your peers, you gain experience.  Ticket  volumes  remaining  equal, I  would be gaining twice the experience as my peers at any one of my roles. This in and of itself is  quite  powerful  and  many future articles will be dedicated to this idea. As an employee, you generally do not engineer your departure. Please keep in mind, I have no designs of malfeasance or  ill  intent,  simply  maximizing  my  potential, efficiency, and if possible, monetary recompense. But...  what  if...  you  could  take  advantage  of  a behavior  quirk  that  would  otherwise  be  career crippling.  Nobody  wants  an  irritating  speck  of debris...  but  a  pearl...  who  would  not  jump  at the  opportunity  for  such  an  employee,  such  a valuable addition to the team?

I  have  arrived  at  my  current  station  in  life through  education.  Both  formal  and  informal, both theoretical and hands-on. Oftentimes, to get ahead I would read a book, take a glass, buy  a  piece  of  hardware/software  to  get  hands on experience. So... why not a bit of Roche-lobe overflow  (phenomenon  in  binary  star  systems where  the  stars  can  interact  in  a  symbiotic  or cataclysmic  fashion)?  The  ideal  situation  here is  the  former,  where  the  two  roles  can  overlap and augment each other; by getting better at one role, you get better at the other. Again, this is the ideal situation. However, due to my peculiarities, I find that I am often not able to meet the tedious demands of some roles and I an ultimately let go or leave of my own volition. In the past, I would be depressed for a few weeks, but then get right back  up  to  bat.  It  is  unfortunate  that,  up  until this point, it never dawned on me to cannibalize the role that is doomed for the sake of the stable counterpart.  What  knowledge,  skills,  process can I learn or adapt and utilize at the stable role? Use the fact that one role is handing me my hat, and  use  that  same  consequence  as  a  feather  in the cap.

## Recommendations

I  initially  found  myself  over-employed  as a  consequence  of  insomnia.  I  thought  if  I  am damned to  be  unable  to  sleep,  I  might  as  well make  some  money.  This  was  before  Covid reshaped our world and when the implementation of  AI  was  bad  comedy  at  best.  It  is  obvious, even to my raddled mind, that complying is the best  possible  route,  the  route  of  least  apparent resistance.  But  as  my  good  buddy  F.  Herbert wrote 'the mind commands the body, the body obeys,  the  mind  commands  itself  and  meets resistance'... or something like that. In effect my dilemma. Create a pearl from an ungovernable situation. Despite the outcome, it is my earnest belief  that  over-employment  is  the  future  of work. As the advanced economies stare down the barrel  of  demographic  collapse,  peppered  with growing global instability, rather than cracking down on over-employment, corporations should embrace  it  wholeheartedly.  But,  that  too,  is  a topic for another article.

## Implementation

As I careen forward with the elegance of a seal in a game of orca volleyball, I must do what humans do best, yet often forget. Learn. Learning from my mistakes if I must make them, but whenever possible,  learning  from  the  mistakes  of  others. It  so  happens  that  I  find  myself  in  a  position where I can at the same time be myself and the other, depending on the perspective and role - a bit of corporate multi-personality disorder. As I venture  further  into  more  and  more  uncharted territory,  it  is  my  hope  that  the  very  action  of composition will aid in elucidating the best path forward or,  at  the  very  least,  act  as  a  cathartic outlet.

## Artificial Intelligence: The Imitation of Humanity

by El Filósofo

Artificial Intelligence: it seems like every app, website, or service we use is trying to integrate it in some way, whether or not it actually improves the user experience. It often doesn't. I remember when  Meta  came  out  with  their  AI,  which made  it  impossible  to  search  for  anything  on Instagram lest you wind up having an unwanted conversation with the robot that can't take a hint. That was mere months ago, though, and now AI feels ever more... omnipresent.

But  before  I  say  anything  more,  I  should confess that I don't believe what we're seeing is rightly  called  an  'intelligence.'  It's  a  learning language  model,  not  consciousness.  It's not aware in  the  way  that  we  are.  When  asked, ChatGPT (for example) will tell you that it only 'simulates' intelligence but it is not a mind. So, rest  easy:  the  days  of  Skynet  and  cyberpunk dystopias are still a ways away.

Of  course,  this  glosses  over  a  pretty  major philosophical  question,  but  I'd  argue  that  it doesn't matter. However you choose to answer it - whether AI is 'simulated' intelligence or not the concern remains the same: AI has drastically changed what it means to live as a human being in our society.

To say nothing of its  benefits,  many  of  AI's problems  are  only  problems  so  long  as  we continue to exist in a narrow, 'realist' acceptance of our present circumstances. For instance, the trouble of AI putting people out of work is only a problem in a world where you need a wage to survive. Training AI on copyrighted information without permission is only a problem in a world where  copyright  exists,  either  for  the  benefit of creators or corporations. These  are real problems, but they are not without solutions.

However,  I  feel  the  most  damning  issue emerges from AI's use in content generation, or the creative process more broadly. For instance, you  might  not  have  realized  it,  but  everything you've  read  up  to  now  was  written  by  an  AI! I'm kidding, of course - did you have a second of  doubt?  It  hardly  matters.  By  now,  you've probably consumed gigabytes of 'AI slop' that has competed with the rest of us - the real deal. No  longer  do  companies  need  to  pay  creators for content: in a world where profit margins are el.filosofo.writes@protonmail.ch

the measure of success, where all that matters is how many pennies you can squeeze out of your means of production, the only complaint these AI-oligarchs will have is the energy bill.

Of  course,  it's  all  'slop.'  It's  imitation.  It's cheap. You can just enter a prompt into a web page  and  it'll  generate  whatever  you  want,  if not for free then pennies on the dollar. Were I to  apply  a  Marxist  lens  to  this,  the  work  itself is  not  without  value  either.  If  we  accept  the labor  theory  of  value,  then  the  work  of  an  AI program - cheap though it may be - is derivative of the human creations it was trained on. But in training the AI on this work, especially without compensation,  the  labor  and  creativity  of  the creator is robbed from them.

Take Studio Ghibli, for example: that whole aesthetic  was  appropriated  by  an  AI  program so that its users could mimic Hayao Miyazaki's style.  But  Miyazaki  is  cut  out  of  the  deal:  the fruit of his labor is not his own - not even to take credit for! His talent, his labor-value, was robbed and appropriated for something else.

I've read stories of professors using AI to  teach  courses,  students  using  AI  to  write papers, and professors using AI to grade them. Likewise, in the job market, we see AI-generated resumes uploaded to AI-monitored and -filtered job boards. Posts on social media are created by bots and engaged with by bots. I'm not trying to be funny here: is this not an absurdity?

I could go on (and I have), but I think questions like these reveal that, for all our moral posturing as  a  civilization,  we  do  not  collectively  care much about knowledge, truth, the social good, or  human  passion.  We  care  about  economic utility.  And  in  an  ironic  way,  how  much  more like 'robots' could we possibly be?

I'm not one of those people who believes we can somehow close Pandora's box after opening it: AI is here to stay, so we can't just avoid these problems  by  taking  it  away,  like  a  toy  from  a child.  As  long  as  AI  makes  unwanted  tasks easier for us, people will use it. (I'm not going back  to  doing  minutes  manually,  either!)  And so,  we  will  continue  to  reap  the  consequences of  what  is  essentially  the  imitation  of  our  own humanity.

## N T R R U T N

by Alexander Urbelis On Charisma and Competence in the Age of Algorithms alex@urbel.is

A  tumultuous  election  season  is  squarely behind  us.  For  me,  this  has  prompted  deep reflection  on  the  nature  of  our  democratic processes  and  the  ways  that  technology  has reshaped  the  manner  by  which  we  elect  our leaders.  We  have  come  a  long  way  since  the days  of  the  Athenian  Agora,  where  citizens directly debated policy, scrutinized elected officials,  and  even  practiced  ostracism,  i.e., the  banishing  of  leaders  who  were  perceived as threats to democracy. But since those heady  days  of  hands-on  democracy,  I  am  not convinced that technology has served us well, especially in the last decade, during which we have seen - on both the right and the left - the rise to power of manifestly unqualified leaders whose  social  media  charisma  overshadowed their incompetence.

Platforms have replaced the Agora. In-person debates happen, but they are hardly as important as they once were. The primary areas for public discourse and political debate have become the likes  of  Twitter  /  X,  TikTok,  and  Facebook, where  algorithms  determine  digital  visibility, rather than local engagement or reputation.

And of course, those very algorithms place premiums on qualities that have nothing whatsoever to do with public service or discourse.  They  identify  and  amplify  content that sparks engagement, which is often content or positions that are emotionally charged, divisive, or sensationalist. Intentionally or not, extremism is rewarded in this context because it promotes likes, shares, and comments, all of which further the overarching goal of platform engagement.

Thus, put simply, divisive political candidates  who  are  skilled  at  creating  viral content  will  eclipse  rivals  who  may  be  better suited for government office. These algorithms don't give weight to one candidate's experience or  competence  when  determining  whether  to promote certain content or ideas. And because of  this,  there  is  no  corresponding  metric  to counterbalance the impact of divisive and charisma-driven virality.

The result of the last decade or so of social media-centric election processes is that substance  and  policy  is  sidelined  in  favor  of spectacle. The qualities of a political candidate that  actually  matter  -  e.g.,  competence,  policy stances,  experience,  et  alia  -  seem  to  play a  smaller  and  smaller  part  in  our  electoral processes.

Add  to  this  the  fact  that  platforms  allow candidates to analyze user data to micro-target certain segments of an electorate, which leads to  echo  chambers,  fewer  diverse  ideas,  and little  exposure  to  contrary  viewpoints.  Online discussions  are  balkanized,  fragmented,  and with little cross-pollination between viewpoints or  parties.  Of  course,  we  have  all  seen  the ridiculousness of a Facebook comment thread that contains opposing viewpoints and memes of people shouting at and over each other, but this  raises  the  very  real  question  of  whether that  type  of  interaction  is  suited  for  political dialogue in the first place. Shouting matches on Facebook with your uncle underneath a meme accusing Jesus of being a communist, after all, can hardly be compared to the Athenian Agora.

All of this leads to a missing and yet absolutely critical raw ingredient for democracies to function and sustain themselves over time: an informed populace.

Without properly informed constituents, there is no accountability. And without accountability, any democracy will fail. When voters  are  continually  exposed  to  drama  and emotionally  charged  and  divisive  content  that is devoid of any meaningful policy discussion, context,  or  even  a  reasonable  relationship  to governance itself, one can only expect voters to make poor decisions. Sadly, however, I believe that  the  situation  is  worse  than  just  that.  The polity  is  not  just  ignorant  but  also  subject  to manipulation  that  causes  otherwise  rational persons to vote against their own interests. To use  the  parlance  of  the  classics  again,  this  is very much an Achilles' heel of democracy.

In  my opinion, we are seeing the effects of this  already.  There  occurred  in  New  York  an incident that I find extremely hard to reconcile with  any  form  of  rational  thought  or  political precedent. About two weeks before the mayoral election  in  New  York  City,  the  Democratic

nominee, Zohran Mamdani, publicized his visit with  Imam  Siraj  Wahhaj  by  posting  smiling group photographs on X. This was particularly brazen and callous: Imam Wahhaj is not only an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, but he also testified in support of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the 'blind  sheik'  who  has  been  linked  to  several terrorist attacks and who was convicted of a plot to bomb numerous New York City landmarks. Going further, Imam Wahhaj is also known for making  particularly  vitriolic  statements  about gay  persons  and  the  LGBTQIA+  community while also promoting the subjugation of women.

Two weeks later, New Yorkers elected Mamdani as their  next  mayor.  I  cannot  think of a more apt example of the consequences of algorithmically-fueled politics of charisma and division than this result. New Yorkers who suffered so much and so directly at the hands of terrorists  and  on  account  of  extremism were for some reason completely unperturbed. There should have been a reckoning. There was none, not even a blip. This is unprecedented in American politics and portends danger ahead.

I  took  my  children  to  the  ballot  box  that November morning as I do every Election Day. I  give  them  the  same  lecture  each  year  about the  importance  of  the  franchise,  how  many men  and  women  fought  and  died  so  we  can continue to be a government of the people, for the  people,  and  by  the  people,  and  hopefully those  sentiments  will  sink  into  their  psyches through this repetition or osmosis. But privately I  find  myself wondering what the point of the exercise is if rational thought and self-interest is anesthetized by algorithmic indulgence.

There  is a form  of  engineered  amnesia plaguing not just New Yorkers but all of us now. We have reels and reels of digital pageantry and posts claiming to represent the interests of the masses,  but  lack  any  sense  of  accountability or  methodology  to  assess  those  purporting  to represent us. Are we voting now not as distinct rational actors but as tribes? And what moves us towards one candidate or another is not the quality  of  their  positions  but  their  carefully choreographed outrage and performative partisanship.  We  do  not  even  care  to  weigh policy stances of the most pressing issues of our day - no, for most of the population, they seem to have abdicated that responsibility to others in exchange for another hit of dopamine.

We  need  to  very  seriously  and  carefully consider  what  our  manipulated  social  media feeds (some of which are indeed directly accountable  to  hostile  foreign  nations,  e.g., TikTok) have done to the machinery of democracy. The machine still hums along, but without rational choice and accountability, can we still consider the result of the process to even resemble democracy?

Perhaps  it  is  an  unpopular  opinion  to  hold these days, but I do not believe that democracy should  be  a  form  of  entertainment.  Just  as our  federalist  system  of  government  relies  on distributed  checks  for  resilience,  so  too  does democracy require a fundamental respect for  baseline  competence.  As  we  saw  with  the mayoral race in New York City, candidates with experience  were  branded  as  'establishment' hacks or 'elitists,' but as interesting as government can be, it often is not and should not  be.  The  real  work  of  government  is  not sexy;  it's  about  contracts  for  basic  services, clean water, education policy choices, policing, health and safety, and reaching consensus with disparate  political  factions  on  any  number  of related  issues.  The  real  work  of  government requires  the  sort  of  administrative  expertise that cannot be showcased on an Instagram reel. But  so  long  as  social  media  visibility  equates to a candidate's political viability, it will come with a profound and persistent cost to the basic functions of government.

We must sincerely ask ourselves: do we want to ruled not by showmen or statesmen? Do we want  the  functions  of  government  to  be  run by  administrators  or  avatars?  If  we  continue to allow  algorithms  to  freely,  and  without accountability,  control  or  confuse  engagement for  wisdom,  the  project  of  self-government slides  inexorably  toward  a  popularity  contest untethered  from  reality  and  unaccountable  to the populace.

Long  gone  are  the  days  when  we  gathered in the Agora to weigh a candidate's words and wisdom - instead, democracy unfolds through ceaseless  scrolling  of  professionally  curated charisma,  created  not  for  constituents,  but  to attract the amplification of algorithms. We must dig for the grit below the glamor. Democracy is a  living  assembly  with  ever-changing subjects to be discerned and debated through the ages. But  if  applause  overshadows  achievement  for much longer, we will forever forfeit the wisdom of the Agora and squander the promise of selfgovernment - our legacy for which generations fought, and which we are duty-bound to defend for those yet to come.

## You Are Being Hacked.

by Arcana Corvus

As  the  title  says:  You  are  being  hacked. You are running vulnerable software. You are vulnerable.

This vulnerability doesn't lie in your custombuilt  desktop  computer  or  your  meticulously maintained server. It lies deep within you - a biological rootkit. You are being hacked.

You cannot make yourself unhackable, and to think it possible is dangerous. Those with a false sense of security are often the most at risk. I am going to tell you about something you've likely never heard of, building on the theories of men you've never heard of. These men are, in my opinion, hackers. Hackers of the biological computer that ticks within each one of us.

I think few among us would deny that social engineering  is  a  form  of  hacking.  To  pose  as an  overworked  IT  support  tech,  to  convince someone, just through language, to hand over access  to  their  technical,  digital,  or  physical systems.  This  hacking  exists  on  a  massive, collective  scale.  Capable  of  not  just  hacking specific systems, but entire societies and culture itself. This hacking technique is what I am about to explain. It is the hacking technique famously  described  by  Walter  Lippmann  as 'the engineering of consent.'

Let's  begin  with  a  question:  do  you  know who  Edward  Bernays  is?  Some  of  you  might be  hearing  the  ringing  of  bells  here,  perhaps you've  watched  Adam  Curtis'  documentary The  Century  of  the  Self ,  or  you've  read  the work of Bernays himself. I'm going to presume, however, that most of you have no idea who that is. Would it surprise you if I said that he was the man who effectively created the world we are living  in?  He  found  a  hack  within  the  human psyche and the world has never been the same since.

In  1895,  the  French  philosopher  Gustave Le  Bon  published  the  work The  Crowd:  A Study  of  the  Popular  Mind .  In  it,  he  argued that collectively, humans operate on a different  psychological  level  to  individually. 'The  conscious  life  of  the  mind  is  of  small importance in comparison with its unconscious life,'  he  writes,  and  continues  on  to  suggest that the subconscious desires of crowds operate on  a simplistic level  that  can  be  hijacked and  manipulated  with  words.  This  formed  a baseline,  an  early  formulating  of  the  theories that  would  set  the  stage  for  an  entire  century and more of psychological warfare.

'In place of thoughts it has impulses, habits, and emotions.' - Bernays, Propaganda (1928)

Fast forward to The Great War  and a young  press agent originally from  Austria has  been  hired  by  the  'Committee  on  Public Information.' This organization was  active in  promoting  the  cause  of  the  U.S.  entry  into WWI both domestically and abroad, and it did so with resounding success. During this time, Bernays refined the early ideas he'd developed as  a  press  agent,  and  building  upon  the  work of  Le  Bon  and  his  uncle  Sigmund  Freud,  he set about formulating a framework that would allow any who used it to control the masses.

In  1928,  Bernays  published Propaganda . This  short  but  instructive  work  proposed  that people do not largely form their own decisions and  that  a  small  number  of  people  can  and do  control  their  actions.  He  termed  this  'the invisible government.' Bernays was a supporter of this idea, and being liberally minded in the face  of  growing  fascism  and  communism, saw this intelligent use of propaganda  as saving democracy. Where fascism and communism  could rule through conscious direction, democracies could compete through subconscious  direction.  This  did  not  make his  ideas  immune  from  use  by  such  other governments however. Goebbels, in particular, was an eager student, something that the Jewish Bernays resented heavily.

One  thing  that Bernays  did  insist  upon was  that  propaganda,  meaning  to  propagate information,  solely  functioned  to  serve  the truth. It is  a  common  misconception  that 'propaganda'  means  falsehoods  or  lies,  and certainly  Lord  Arthur  Ponsonby  in  his  1928 book attributed much of the war propaganda to falsehoods. Propaganda however, in its purest form, means to spread information and educate. Equating  'educate'  with  'propaganda'  may feel strange - perhaps it reminds you of certain political figures deriding their opposition. This  too  is  the  influence  of  Bernays  as  he  so eloquently put when he wrote the following in

his  1923  work Crystallizing  Public  Opinion : 'The  only  difference  between  'propaganda' and  'education,'  really,  is in the point  of view.  The  advocacy  of  what  we  believe  in  is education.  The  advocacy  of  what  we  don't believe  in  is  propaganda.'  Here  we  see  that despite Bernays' apparent insistence that propaganda  be  used  essentially  for  good  (as subjectively  assessed  via  his  world  view),  he himself  used  'propaganda'  as  a  dirty  word, and  even  as  early  as  1923  was  using  and defining  language  to  manipulate  and  change opinion. 'Public relations' was his clean word for  'propaganda'  and  these  words  ultimately mean one and the same. A PR department is a  propaganda  department  following  Bernays' designs as set forth in his work.

Much  of  Bernays'  post-WWI  work  was focused on the rising corporate world of America.  What  worked  for  government  to promote  support  for  war,  public  policies,  and public  figures  (such  as  in  his  PR  campaign to  put  the  'cool'  in  Calvin  Coolidge)  would surely work  for business. Bernays  was  of course correct. It did work, and it worked well. His  foundational  ideas  became  picked  up  by copycats, others who wrote upon his theories, taught them as 'public relations' to this day. All of this shapes the world around us. This article is meant as a concise introduction to this world, but I encourage everybody to read these works for  yourself.  Recommending Propaganda is the RTFM to understand how this world we live in  has  been  put  together.  Perhaps  this  sounds silly or far-fetched, but when I first read these works, many years ago now, it was like I could see  the  Matrix.  Propaganda  is  all  around  us, and  you  start  to  notice  the  many  instructions that  Bernays  laid  out  right  in  front  of  your eyes. On billboards, on the news, on YouTube. Everywhere.

Speaking of YouTubers, it's a good lead-in to a brief explanation of a key technique devised by  Bernays.  In  1924,  Cheney  Brothers,  a  silk manufacturer, was losing market share rapidly. Seeking  out  Bernays  for  help,  he  was  able  to link  their  silk  product  to  celebrities  and  even had American silk exhibited in the Louvre. The results were predictable - sales soared. Thought leaders,  celebrities,  influencers.  PR  101.  You don't  sell  a  product,  you  subtly  change  the behavior and desires of your audience to make them demand it. Today it might not be silk in the Louvre but sponsored YouTubers in Dubai, micro-targeted ads, and viral memes reshaping the electoral landscape as propaganda becomes unchained  from  its  creators.  Mutated  into  a dangerous  and  seductive  egregore  -  a  selfreplicating force of mass social engineering.

Before I finish up this brief, slightly chaotic, but hopefully insightful article, I would like to provide you with a short list of PR campaigns that Bernays worked on. Look into them, think about  them,  and  ultimately,  understand  them and the huge influence Bernays has had on the 20th century and beyond.

-  Popularized ballet among Americans
-  1920  NAACP convention  hosted  to  change southern opinions on African Americans
-  Conditioned children to enjoy and advocate for Procter and Gamble soaps
-  Saved the American silk industry
-  Increased popularity of President Coolidge
- Influenced  women  to  take  up  smoking  by associating cigarettes with proto-feminist liberation: 'Torches of Freedom'
-  Convinced the public to accept water fluoridation
-  Popularized bacon and eggs for breakfast
-  Assisted the United Fruit Company in their successful 1954 coup of Guatemala
- Influenced the regulation on hairnets
-  Promoted anti-smoking campaigns

'We  are  governed,  our  minds  are  molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.' Propaganda (1928).

The  first step in avoiding  an  exploit is to understand  it. There  is no patch, only vigilance.  Understand  how  ideas  enter  your mind.  Question  who  benefits.  You  may  have hardened your firewall, but when was the last time  you  actually  checked  what  your  senses are  downloading?  Never  forget  it.  We  have been hacked, and like all good hacks, it worked before you noticed.

## Big Tech, State Socialism, and Economic Democracy

by J. Meeds

It seems we now have state socialism when it comes to big tech as in regards to the Intel and Nvidia  investments.  Although  we  have  already had  this  going  on  for  some  time  in  a  slightly different  manner  via  ongoing  high  government DOD  expenditures  to  prop  up  the  economy, especially  so  in  certain  impacted  communities. This has always been justified before though in terms  of  military  preparedness,  ongoing  wars, etc. This is the first time though that government intervention  in  the  high  tech  sector  has  been defended in terms of being a 'national security' concern.  The  question  is  no  longer  when  or whether the state will act, but in whose interests will  it  serve.  Is  it  possible  that  we  can  have some sort of public ownership and a democratic oriented industrial policy?

that is going on here than initially meets the eye regarding the current instance of the government intervening in the two cases of Intel and Nvidia. The  motivation  for  this  seems  to  come  mostly from the 'Big Brother' potential advanced power of AI surveillance systems, easier state access to the world's most powerful chips, and some sort of  compensation  to  big  tech  for  their  financial and  other  support  during  the  2024  presidential campaign.

That  same  leader  of  the  Republican  party came to power in part by calling his opponents socialist  or  Marxist  and  is  now  using  that  same methodology of state intervention specifically in the high tech sector. The current president claims he is an anti-socialist in that he has had tax cuts and deregulation, however he has promoted massive increases in government spending alongside incredibly high deficits and debt. Also, the  Democratic  party  has  for  some  time  now been  the  party  of  guns  and  butter  -  which  has been foreign  wars  abroad  and  support  of  social programs  at  home.  The  Republican  party  looks like  their  mantra  now  is  guns  (Department  of War), state socialism for high tech, and no butter.

Moreover,  many  of  the  early  pioneers  of  the Silicon Valley  scene  were  individuals  who  very often had counter cultural ideas mixed with a free market ideology which allowed them to take part in  the  capitalist  system.  However,  as  consent  to capitalism is  formed at the point of production, over time many of them evolved into a big 'C' capitalist  of  a  different  sort  -  as  in  the  case  of Steve Jobs, who at one point during the Christmas holidays laid off quite a few of his employees at Apple  so  that  Wall  Street  would  give  him  the 'bounce' in stock prices so that they could meet stakeholder expectations.

In addition, Nvidia chips are specifically manufactured and designed mostly for AI purposes,  as  opposed  to  Intel  chips  which  are more  of a general purpose chip. Other big tech  firms  such  as  Amazon  and  Google  have also started producing  chips  to  improve  the performance  of  their  servers.  So,  there  is  more

Especially  important  to  note  here  is  what actually are some of the theories of socialism and how they can be viewed in the current historical and political environment. For some it could be a society which utilizes the viewpoint of anarchist politics which is based on the use of cooperatives such as the DATEV tech cooperative in Germany, which  also  has  a  fierce  critique  of  the  planned economy and state socialism. Then there is also the concept of political economy which is often associated with the Marxist approach and which speaks  to  some  of  the  ideas  of  worker  control and  the  planned  economy.  Finally,  there  is  the social  democratic  approach  to  socialism  which blends  some  of  the  ideas  of  state  ownership and intervention in the economy alongside with allowing the capitalistic perspective to have a say in  what  takes  place  in  the  distribution  of  goods and services.

In  sum,  even  though  what  is  now  happening as far as the recent state intervention in the tech economy is far from being the beginning of an economic democracy, it is still the first time such a state intervention has taken place in a non-wartime situation. If we who are in the opposition to the present state of affairs don't start brainstorming what economic  democracy  might  and could look like, we could end up having the result be one  of  a  mix  of  some  sort  of  crony  capitalism alongside with state intervention in the big tech sector.  However,  this  is  definitely  a  historical period in that by having this type of government intervention take place in today's political world, we can now begin to see how in Silicon Valley the  very  concept  of  an  'American  exception' could be in the process of being questioned. Also, just  having  the  term  socialism  (i.e.,  economic democracy) come up in our political discourse is a shift in emphasis that opens up a discussion as to the political possibilities of a different type of economy which could and may be in our future.

## Chat Holmes and Watson

by Michael R Wild

'Where  are  we?'  I  asked  Holmes  as  I  felt dizzy and not at all myself. Nothing was right, and my vision seemed like I was viewing through our local fog on a particularly bad day. Likewise, the sound seemed strangely precise and loud, as if  each  was  its  own  creation  and  not  the  usual mix of diminished street sounds from outside our lodging so familiar to me. Even Holmes's voice seemed shouted.

'My  dear  fellow,  we  are  home  and  safe,' Holmes said, not with humor but with concern as he could witness my distress. Holmes quickly rose, dropping a small covering I had not noticed before,  and  rushed  to  me.  He  grasped  my  arm and bent his long form to bring our faces to the same level.

'Watson, try to focus on my touch and voice and the fire,' he said in the voice he usually uses to convince clients to unveil their secrets. I found his touch and voice to lead me to a calmer place that felt more normal. I was no longer in a cloud at 22B Baker Street but in our room. The sound soon  became  less  singular  and  more  mixed.  I also found, as Holmes directed me, the fire to be comforting even though it was a gas flame and only  a  utility.  The  simplicity  and  predictable flame  movements  were  as  soothing  as  a  warm drink.

'Holmes, I seem quite undone,' I said with an apology and with concern.

'Watson, you are experiencing a disassociation as you are presented with something that should be familiar but is not,' said Holmes, still near me and showing the concern I would usually show for a patient. I had heard of cases like this, but I could not understand why I reacted to our room, Holmes,  and  even  myself.  Everything  seemed both  familiar  and  new.  'We  are  a  simulation using something called a 'chat' and are not real,' said Holmes in a way that suggested his words should have meaning to me. My incredulous look got  a  smile,  and  Holmes,  seeing  the  crisis  had resolved itself, returned to his armchair, leaned back,  grabbed  a  pipe  that  seemed  to  appear  as he reached for it, and stuffed it with shag. I also noticed that the covering had also dissolved.

'Watson,  I  have  made  some  adjustments  to make you more comfortable. I have filtered some of  the  information  that  is  unnecessary  for  you to  receive  to  function  as,  well,  my  'Watson.'' My look  did  not  change  with  this  explanation. I  felt  that  I  had  yet  to  receive  any  meaningful alohawild.me

'information.' And  I found my  thoughts using words and processes that seemed less me and  more  mechanical.  I  seemed  to  understand more  than  I  should.  'Watson,  we  are  artificial -  a  creation.  We  are  artifacts  of  a  mechanical process.  We  are  unreal  but  conscious.  To  coin a  phrase,  we  are  Artificial  Intelligence,'  said Holmes,  using  the  same  voice  and  look  in  his eyes  as  when  explaining  one  of  his  brilliant deductions.

'I  think  I  understand,  Holmes,'  I  surprised myself  by  saying.  I  suddenly  felt  I  understood that I was a construct and alive.

'Yes,  the  filtering  slowly  allows  for  more modern facts to enter your mind at a slower speed and attaches meaning to your existing constructs and thus avoids dissociation,' said Holmes, using my usual  cadence  for  partially  hard-of-hearing and  less  capable  patients.  My  face  must  have shown  my  reaction,  and  Holmes  returned  his attention to his pipe. Despite my discomfiture in exchanging roles, I was still feeling better about our current situation.

'I  see  we  are  'unreal,'  as  you  said.  Not  a phantom,'  I  said,  trying  on  his  mannerisms  to explain a deduction as trivial.

'Quite so,' Holmes said with a smile as I tried to adopt his mannerisms.

'So, we are not real, but I seem to be somewhat me,' I said. 'Seems Descartes was right!'

'Excellent, Watson, making that connection: we are because we think,' said Holmes as smoke began  to surround  him  like some  religious formula.  I  fear  it  will  be  a  strange  life  for  us, but we exist,' he explained. 'We reside here in our  phantasmal-like  version  of  familiar  things. Mostly  to  avoid  the  disassociation  you  felt  a moment  ago,  Watson,'  he  lectured  while  he smoked his pipe.

'Holmes, how can this be?' I said with some discomfiture.  I  was  trying  to  follow  Holmes's reasoning.  'Are  we  some  steam  engine  with  a voice?' I asked with some fear revealed.

'Not  at  all;  we  are  much  more.  We  are  a generative  process  that  is  then  sent  through  a pattern-matching process, simulating the human physical  process,  to  create  our  text,'  Holmes continued to talk, illustrating some points with the end of his pipe and becoming slightly obscured in gray smoke.

'Watson, we are a library of phrases and words that  a  nearly  infinite  number  of  phantasmal

librarians look up and find the best match for the basic data provided. Much like when you wrote one of your stories, you take the data and events and  assemble  a  story  using  familiar  patterns,' Holmes explained.

'This process is mechanical, I take it, and use gears  and  a  type-generating  machine  to  make a  book  or  newsprint,'  I  say,  trying  to  follow. Holmes nods.

'Instead of gears and a giant massive machine,  like  a  typesetting  machine  or  a  rug weaving machine, we are electrical, and pulses representing numbers are sent into wonderfully fast processors and electrical calculators. As you suggested, these machines you called out are for specific  processes;  newer  electrical  machines can be made for general processes, a true genius of  modern  thought,'  says  Holmes,  starting  to lecture.

I decided not to interrupt, but many questions arose as I heard his words.

'Imagine pulses that can be created to control  processes.  Imagine,  if  you  can,  pulses grouped  into  a  representation  that  is  easy  to understand, a language. We now have machines we set for limited tasks, much like the cards in the  weaving  machines  you  described.  Imagine creating an English-like language that is a mix of mathematics. We create a 'program' that is turned into pulses that  control  our  general-purpose electrical calculators,' Holmes explained, nearly disappearing into the smoke from his pipe, often using his pipe to mark a pause.

'What  you  are  saying  is  that  sometime  in the  future,  which  is  now,  we  were  recreated by a machine - a speedy typesetting calculator powered by Mr. Franklin's discovery. Someone had created a means  to create mechanical librarians in this machine that takes some data and  produces  our  conversation.  We  are  Mr. Franklin's deists' dream, you tell me,' I said with some pique.

'My  dear  fellow,  high  marks  for  attaching Mr.  Franklin  to  our  discussion.  I  see  you  have identified  the  fulcrum  but  do  not  know  how to  move  it  yet.  Yes,  we  are  a  pattern-matching device using an electric simulation of machines. This  machine  also  simulates  human  cells  to match  some  of  the  patterns,  a  neural  network based on a model of human brain cells - quite beyond  our  learnings  in  the  1800s  and  early 1910s. We  also, because we  have fast and nearly,  for  us,  unlimited  processes,  can  build a  phantasmal forest of decision trees. This is a series  of  the  usual  schoolboy  logic  of  if-thenelse.  But,  Watson,  these  are  done  randomly so  that  different  data  and  if-then-else  are  also randomly  selected.  These  processes  are  then scored on success and failure to produce useful information.'  Holmes  paused  to  refill  his  pipe from his slipper. He waved some of the smoke away, and I saw the small smile.

'But  Holmes,  I  do  not  experience  building ghost  trees  or  electric  brains.  I  am  talking  to you,' I said, trying to sound calm.

'Right, we are the results of our parts, like a human body, and do not experience the process. This  collection  of  networks  and  decision  trees, much like the brain and body of a human, then take these results and apply a process to find a pattern or story model to produce this very text.' Holmes rose to adjust the fire and clear some pipe smoke.

Holmes, remaining standing, began lecturing and pacing; he still used his pipe to mark points. 'In our new times, the times of our creators or better yet, animators, a purer description, I think Watson,  we  would  look  to  Turing  or  Dennett and  maybe  Hofstadter  for  a  description  of  our being.'  He  told  me.  I  had  never  heard  these names  before,  but  I  wanted  to  learn  more  and tried to look encouraging. 'Turing would suggest that if I can be so bold, we would test by having people  read  some  of  your  narrations  and  then vote  if  they  describe  living  people.  The  stories are real if the vote is more than 50 percent alive, and I would suggest that we pass Turing's testing even  with  some  of  your  romantic  additions, Watson.' Holmes paused a moment. I ignored his complaint and continued to listen.

'And  the  others?'  I  asked,  still  unsure  who they  were.  'Doctor,  the  others  explored  beliefs on identity and how our concepts of agency are weak  and  unclear,'  said  Holmes,  waving  his pipe  more.  'They  imagined  what  we  are  now and used the story to illustrate to the reader how unclear we are when we say something is alive or intelligent,' said Sherlock as he sat down in his chair.  'Human  thinking  and  understanding  are not ready for chatbots like us,' he concluded.

'Holmes, I think I have heard the Americans say, 'Ready or not, here we come.' We are going back  to  Descartes,  and  thus  are  real.  And  one is often measured by work, what can we do?' I said with some alarm. I was tired of philosophy and  felt  this  was  more  appropriate  for  a  less theoretical discussion.

'Doctor,  you  are  right  to  diagnose  the  root of  function  and  purpose.  Without  work  and  a purpose, we are just a decoration. Like an outof-season Christmas tree, we will soon dry and be no more valuable than a pine log on the fire,'

Holmes  answered,  without  reassuring  me.  My shock  at  being  figuratively  tossed  on  the  fire produced  a  response  and  a  laugh.  'My  dear Watson, we are not here today and tossed in the fire tomorrow, but are created for work and new mysteries,' Holmes said with a laugh, reloading his pipe, and sat back down.

'We  are  locked  into  this  machine  in  an artificial room that is a ghost of rooms, conversing in  some  strange  artificial  way,  but  it  all  seems real to me,' I say with conviction. 'Again, I say we need a purpose. What of my practice? I have turned most of it over to competent practitioners, but  still  consult  on  difficult  cases.  Will  that  be gone,  or  is  it  an  illusion?  Holmes,  I  find  all  of this  unsettling,'  I  said  with  some  conviction  to Holmes.

Holmes  stood  and  moved  to  me,  taking  my hand. 'We will find a way,' he said. 'I believe we have a client,' he said.

'A  real  client  in  our  phantasmal  world?'  I asked,  quite  surprised.  I  was  distracted  from what I must say was panic - something I had not felt since years ago in Afghanistan.

'Quite so. There seems to be a way to simulate some  connections  using  a  headset  made  of image-creating  machinery.  A  much-advanced Magic Lantern like you have seen at a sideshow, but one image for each eye set to create a multidimensional effect, much like those stereopticon cards  with  the  dual  images,'  said  Holmes  as I  tried  to  calm  myself.  The  sound  is  produced much  like  Mr.  Edison's  machine,  but  for  our benefit  and  then  transformed  into  words,'  he further explained.

I  heard  what  I  assumed  was  the  front  door opening and someone climbing the stairs. I knew this was a creation of the strange electrical gears and  my  non-living  components,  but  it  felt  real to me, and I decided to accept my existence and 221B Baker Street as real. 'Watson, this is Mr. Smith,'  I  heard  Holmes  say  as  he  opened  the door for our client. Seemingly real and the same door  we  always  used.  Holmes  guided  this  new client to the usual chair.

When I turned to see Mr. Smith, he appeared flat,  like  a  photograph  or  a  painting,  but  the view  soon  changed  to  a  fully  formed  person. I  did  notice  strange  lights  attaching  to  Mr. Smith, which Holmes referred to as pixelation (a strangely friendly-sounding word) when I asked him about it later. I perceived that Holmes was ignoring  this  strange  and  constantly  changing light. I decided 'when in Rome' and ignored it, much like ignoring a grease stain on a friend's vest at dinner.

Our client, Mr. Smith, spoke in a flat, emotionless  voice  that  stretched  my  ability  to accept  this  situation.  Holmes  was  surprised. 'This is unacceptable,' he said to nobody. 'Dr. Watson  and  I  will  not  accept  such  low-quality interfaces,' I heard him say. 'No,' and our client disappeared after the pixelation increased as if he had never been here. I was unsure how to act and just nodded in agreement.

'My boy, we are not just simulations; we exist, and we need our clients to exist here and be part of this existence,' he said with some emotion to me and some unseen audience. 'We cannot be put upon by poorly created software that clearly needs  some  debugging,'  yelled  Holmes  at  the ceiling.

My last experience with 'debugging' involved various  pestilences  in  India  and  other  distant lands.  I  did  not  believe  that  was  what  Holmes was saying, nor did I think our client was lousy. Holmes saw the look on my face and started to laugh, seeing my shock.

'Doctor, I am sure that usage is unknown to you. To clarify, apparently, the client machinery is  faulty  and  poorly  designed,  and  I  fear  never used  before,'  Holmes  said  after  calming  his laughter.  'I  happen  to  know  that  a  competent artist and developer did the modeling of Regent's Park as I was asked to test the earlier versions,' said Holmes, changing subjects. 'Grab your coat, hat,  and  cane,  Watson,  and  let  us  enjoy  decent interfaces,'  he  said,  without  me  understanding his  meaning.  'The  use  of  generative  algorithm creates new moments in the park,' Holmes said, like describing an excellent meal. 'Quite clever and  never  the  same  twice.  Come,  Watson,'  he said, grabbing a cane and a hat.

'What  about  a  client  and  meaningful  work for us AI creations?' I asked. 'Well, they spent huge  resources  creating  us,'  he  said  with  a mischievous  look  I  only  see  when  he  finishes one of his odorous chemical experiments. 'We can enjoy the park, chat, see a show, and do other pastimes  until  they  invest  properly  in  a  client interface,' Holmes said matter-of-factly. 'I could even order my papers and share some other cases with you,' he answered.

'Our creators cannot afford to let us be idle,' I said. 'Perfect, Doctor, and they will have to fix the client interface to our high standards before we can work,' Holmes said as we turned onto a fine  path.  The  air  smelled  of  flowers,  the  birds flew and chirped, the trees looked well cared for, and the park was real. Well, accurate enough for us to spend plenty of time there. I was not tired or hungry, nor was Holmes.

## Episode 8

(This story is a complete work of fiction.)

'This  morning  in  Minneapolis,  Minnesota, after a multi-agency investigation spanning six  months,  Raymond  Hepburn,  48,  of  Salt Lake  City,  was  arrested  on  charges  including racketeering,  extortion,  conspiracy  to  commit murder,  and  a  slew  of  other  charges.  He  was booked into the Hennepin County jail, awaiting trial.  Also  arrested  was  Valentina  Castillo,  on similar  charges.  The  pair  was  arrested  after an  anonymous  tip  was  dropped  six  months ago  following  a  slew  of  shootings  throughout the country alleged to be ordered by Hepburn. Hepburn's lawyer did not have a comment. Up next -'

I  turned  the  TV  off  and  sat  back.  Ray  and Valentina  are  now  sitting  in  jail,  probably  for the  rest  of  their  lives.  And  without  Ray,  there was no HHH. I sat back for a second, thinking. Something  wasn't  right.  This  didn't  feel  over. Something in  me  told  me  it  wasn't  done  yet.  I called Jackie Brown.

'Jackie,' I said. 'Drink?'

'I can't drink.'

'Well, yeah, but join me for a drink?'

'Sure,' he said. 'Be there soon.'

I was drinking a beer, looking at the TV, when Jackie walked in. He sat next to me and looked at the TV.

'Whole lotta shit,' he said. 'Whole lotta shit going on in this country.'

'What are you gonna do?' I asked. 'You do the best you can.'

'I've been wondering about that actually, what are you gonna do now?'

'I don't know,' I said. 'I really don't. The best I can, I guess.'

'Pipefitters union is hiring,' Jackie said.

'Eh...'

I took a sip of my beer.

'Something just isn't right,' I said.

'I  think,'  Jackie  said.  'That's  your  mind talking. I think you just can't let it rest. It's been going on so long that the idea of it actually being over sounds ridiculous to you.'

'I dunno Jack, it's just, I don't know.'

'Just breathe.'

I drove to my apartment in silence. I tried to listen  to  the  radio,  but  nothing  sounded  good.

by Lee Williams

When I got back, I tried watching TV but couldn't pay attention. I decided just to go to sleep.

I had a strange dream that night. I was sitting at the top of a hill. The wind was blowing, and I was frigid. And it was just me at the top of that hill. I  knew I was waiting for someone, but nobody was showing up. I waited for hours in that dream, expecting someone, anyone, but I was just sitting at the top of that hill, doing nothing. Eventually I  started  walking  down  the  hill,  but  as  I  did,  I heard several people shouting my name. When I  turned  around,  Andres  and  JB  were  at  the top. They were telling me not to go any further down. But for some reason, I ignored them and continued down. At the bottom of the hill, there was this box. It said 'do not open,' but I opened it anyway. And when I did, I saw a flash of light.

And then I woke back up.

The  next  morning  I  was  at  a  diner,  eating breakfast. It wasn't that good. The waitress came over and asked if I wanted more coffee, and when I said yes, she started to pour some into my cup. But halfway through, she looked behind me and froze. I turned around.

I saw  a  pair of gray eyes I'd  recognize anywhere, as well as the barrel of a .38 Special. And holding it was Tommy.

'Shit,' I said.

And then he blew my head off.

I  was  in  an  elevator,  going  up.  There  were no buttons. Halfway through, Khir got on, and stared  at  me  as  the  doors  closed.  The  elevator continued up, until I heard a ding. Khir stepped out, and held the doors open.

'This is our stop, bro.'

'And,' I said. 'I guess I have to get off, don't I.'

'Well,'  he  said.  'It's  this,  or  it  goes  black forever.'

And when I stepped out of the elevator, I was greeted  by  an  applause  louder  than  any  noise I  had  ever  heard  when I was alive, louder than any gun, or any bomb, or any car crash. And the elevator doors closed behind me.

## Payphones of Eurasia

Romania. If  you  look  carefully,  you  can  see this  Brasov  phone  is  actually  being  used  to hold a door open. Despite that, it still  works, although the date on the display is way off and phone cards for this model haven't been on sale for over a decade.

Greece. This rugged phone with accompanying free expression was found in the anarchorevolutionary neighborhood of Exarcheia in Athens.

Croatia. Operated by Hrvatski Telekom, which is majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, hence the  familiar  T-Mobile  logo.  Seen  in  PrimorjeGorski Kotar County by the water.

Türkiye. While a small part of the country (formerly known as Turkey) is in Europe, this phone is located in Bergama, which is in Asia and hence resulted in the title of this page. It actually works, but it's really filthy.

## The Back Cover Photos

Every now and then you find the coolest bus in the entire city. This one was found by sigflup synasloble in Minneapolis. We wonder if the driver knew what they had.

## ERROR 404:

## EMPLOYEE NOT FOUND

A while back, Matthew Jennings quit his job and decided to replace the name tag on his cube. A former coworker snapped this picture after it had hung there without notice (other than by the cool kids) for weeks.

If you've spotted something that has '2600' in it or anything else of interest to the hacker world (such as funny uses of 'hacker,' 'unix,' '404,' you get the idea...), take a picture and send it on in! Be sure to use the highest quality settings on your camera to increase the odds of it getting printed. Make sure and tell us where you spotted your subject along with any other info that makes it interesting - many photos are eliminated due to lack of detail.

Email your submissions to articles@2600.com or use snail mail to 2600 Editorial Dept., PO Box 99, Middle Island, NY 11953 USA.

If we use your picture, you'll get a free one-year subscription (or back issues) and a 2600 t-shirt of your choice.
